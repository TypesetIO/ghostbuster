Introducing a second reference data set z that follows the same covariance properties (Eq.( 3)) as y (commonly referred to as triple collocation analysis, TCA; Stoffelen, 1998; Scipal et al., 2008b; Gruber et al., 2016a) allows, under particular circumstances, simultaneous estimation of the uncertainty of all three products and also (partly) isolation of random (relative) representativeness errors (Miralles et al., 2010; Gruber et al., 2013a; Chen et al., 2017) .Note, however, that the necessity of using two reference data sets instead of one may limit spatial and temporal data availability.
