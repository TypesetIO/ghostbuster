A smart home hacking investigation revealed that, in a week, smart home devices, such as televisions, thermostats, smart kettles, and security systems, were attacked by cybercriminals and unknown entities more than 12,000 times (Wang et al., 2022) .An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network security system that identifies abnormal intrusion traffic through network data analysis and intercepts the intrusion traffic, significantly reducing the success rate of network attacks.
