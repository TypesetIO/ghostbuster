The package uses estimation of the parameters of a spatio-temporal model using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and estimation of the parameter of standard errors using a spatio-temporal parametric bootstrap and spatial mapping (Ndaba, 2022) .R users can attest to its functional flavor due to the absence of pointers, many libraries for specific tasks, exponentially growing add-ons, beautiful plots, resistance to hacking and little syntactic overhead, ease, less verboseness, free open-source multi-paradigm language, effective data storage and handling flair, immeasurable data processing capabilities, support installation on UNIX, MacOS, and Windows platforms, and a provision for internet distribution and automatic installation (Hackenberger, 2020; Pfeiffer & Pia, 2013; Pothigai & Sundararajan, 2021; Schneider & Lauber, 2020) .
