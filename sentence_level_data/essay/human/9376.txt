A truly gifted life;
* 0800 she wakes to the gentle chorus of lyrebirds saying beautiful things
* 0810 she walks down her mahogany floored hallway to her private shower
* 0840 she towels off...
* 0850 is breakfast, prepared not by a machine, but a personal chef
* 0945 she dresses for work
* 1100 she heads to work, her chauffeur navigating her helicopter through the busy air ways.
