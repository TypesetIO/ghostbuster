It was also observed that all resources except AGORA2 and gapseq produced very high amounts of ATP (up to 1,000 mmol g dry A mechanistic systems biology approach that includes a detailed stoichiometric representation of metabolism is constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) 8 .COBRA relies on genome-scale reconstructions of the target organisms which are often manually curated based on the available literature 8 .
