Compared to polycrystal VO x thin films, the graded-doped single-crystal W x V 1−x O 2 may have other advantages: (1) possibly low 1/f noise (another main factor affecting device sensitivity) because of its single-crystallinity and thus much fewer domain/grain boundaries; 42 and (ii) high effective infrared absorption due to the existence of the M phase with an absorption coefficient 5−100 times higher than that of the I phase in the infrared range of wavelength > ∼ 8 μm. 43, 44 he axially engineered MIT in the graded-doped W x V 1−x O 2 NWs also provides a means for constructing broad-range thermal microactuators.
