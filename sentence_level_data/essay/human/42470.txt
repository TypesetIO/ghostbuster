The abundance and species of core bacteria have been found to be remarkably stable, showing little effect across various habitats (Anderson et al., 2015; Kwong and Moran, 2016; Hammer et al., 2021) .Host-specific bacteria have diverse functions in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, as well as in defending against pathogen colonization and reinforcing the host's immune system (Zheng et al., 2017; Kešnerová et al., 2019; Ribière et al., 2019) .However, most studies have focused on interactions between gut bacteria and social bees, such as A. mellifera and Bombus terrestris, and the study of solitary bees has been scarcely investigated.
