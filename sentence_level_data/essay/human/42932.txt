However, most targeted drugs are not exclusively specific for cancer, because they usually inhibit wild-type versions of proteins, which can often be expressed in a wide range of tissues (e.g.HER2 is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, 5 and crizotinib 6 and imatinib 7 inhibit wild-type ALK and ABL tyrosine kinases, respectively, as well as the underlying cancer-specific gene fusions), and some small-molecule inhibitors, particularly first-generation agents, are multi-specific, thus showing additional on-target activity (e.g.crizotinib also inhibits MET and ROS1, 8, 9 and imatinib also inhibits c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor 10 ).
