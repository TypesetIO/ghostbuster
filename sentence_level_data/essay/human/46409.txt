For example, Hanberry analyzed the spatial relationship between population density and temperature zoning, and the results showed that population density increased with a decrease in monthly maximum temperature in the hypertropical zone [6] , indicating that concentrated populations generally did not develop at high maximum monthly temperatures of ≥36 • C.
