Another research performed a comparative study between RF, kNN, and SVM to classify six different classes (including agricultural landscape) by using images taken through Sentinel-2 satellite (Thanh Noi & Kappas, 2018) .A study was conducted for the classification of croplands and this time TerraSAR-X satellite data was used; the significance of RF was noted by comparing its performance with Classification and Regression Tree (CART) (Sonobe et al., 2014) .In (Pena et al., 2014) , nine important crops were classified by considering input from images of ASTER satellite and state-of-the-art ML approaches like DT, LR, SVM, and MLP were utilized for this purpose.
