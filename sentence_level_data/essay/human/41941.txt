Thus, this study extends the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model and uses China's provincial panel data during 2005e2015 to discuss the nonlinear impacts of economic growth, FDI and export on air pollutant emissions, and make an in-depth analysis of the regional differences in these nonlinear impacts from a multi-regional perspective, which can contribute to the research area.
