"Providence," says Achilles Tatius in The Adventures of Leucippe and Clitophon, "sometimes foreshows the future to men in dreams, not so that they may be able to avoid the sufferings fated for them, for they can never get the better of destiny, but in order that they may bear them with the more patience when those sufferings come; for when disasters come all together and unexpectedly, they strike the spirit with so severe and sudden a blow that they overwhelm it; while if they are anticipated, the mind, by dwelling on them beforehand, is able little by little to turn the edge of s o r r ~w ." ~ Later, Synesius will express a completely traditional point of view when he remarks that our dreams constitute an oracle who "dwells with US," who accompanies us "if we go abroad; she is with us on the field of battle, she is at our side in the life of the city; she labors with us in the fields and barters with us in the marketplace"; dreams are to be regarded as "a prophet who is always ready, a tireless and silent adviser.
