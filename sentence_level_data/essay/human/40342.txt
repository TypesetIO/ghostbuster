Whereas IgE binding to the high-affinity receptor FcÎµRI triggers degranulation and cytokine production by mast cells and basophils, IgG bound to the inhibitory receptor FcgRIIb counters these effects, suppressing allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, [8] [9] [10] as well as secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines that can exacerbate further reactions by amplifying proallergic T H 2 responses.
