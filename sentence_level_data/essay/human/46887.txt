As a proof of concept, bacterial cells from 30 UTI patients (Supplementary Table 4 ) were tested with two antimicrobial drugs, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and cefazolin (CZ) at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for E. coli-1 μg ml −1 and 4 μg ml −1 for CIP Low and CIP High , respectively, and 16 μg ml −1 and 32 μg ml −1 for CZ Low and CZ High , respectively-to identify drug-susceptible or -resistant bacteria.
