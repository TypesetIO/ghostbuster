The biochar produced from the agricultural residue like rice straw has lower ash content than the biochar produced from the carbohydrate and protein-rich residue (Fu et al., 2019) .However, the hydrochar produced at the same temperature has similar or lower ash content, and this is attributed to the compressed water utilized during the HTC process, which demineralizes the biomass (Smith et al., 2016) .
