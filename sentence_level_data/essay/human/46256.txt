Certainly, aerobic BFR walking exercise conferred a reduced hemodynamic stress in comparison with high-intensity running (TM in Table 2 ), whereas for BFR resistance exercise the hemodynamic response appeared at least equivalent, if not greater, to a high-intensity resistance exercise (LP in Table 2 ).
