There are four approaches to NER: i) a rule-based approach, which does not require annotated data because it relies on artificial rules; ii) an unsupervised learning approach; iii) a feature-based supervised learning approach that relies on supervised learning algorithms with careful feature engineering; and iv) a deep-learning-based approach, which automatically finds the required representation for detecting or classifying raw input in an end-to-end manner [3] , [4] .NER is a straightforward process for humans because many named entities are self-names, and most of them have initial capital letters and can be easily recognized, but for machines, it is very difficult [5] .
