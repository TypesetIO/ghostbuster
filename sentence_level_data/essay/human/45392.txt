The remote sensing community mostly assigns them to the mismatch between the spatial support of a measurement and the spatial resolution of the defined sampling grid, sometimes also referred to as scaling error (Miralles et al., 2010; Crow et al., 2012; Gruber et al., 2013a; Molero et al., 2018) .In the modelling community, representativeness errors mostly refer to a model's lacking ability to represent reality and, as such, to imperfections in the model structure and in parameterization (e.g., unresolved sub-grid scale processes).
