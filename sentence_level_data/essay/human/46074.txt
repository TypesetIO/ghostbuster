Spray robots for weed control have been developed with vertical spray booms that increase the deposition in the canopy [128] [129] [130] .Some of the emerging technologies are the self-propelled vehicles such as Fumimatic® (IDM S.L, Almería, Spain) and Tizona (Carretillas Amate S.L., Almería, Spain), or autonomous field robots such as Fitorobot (Universidad de Almería, Cadia S.L., Almería, Spain) that have been designed specifically to navigate inside fields that has loose soil and operate in situations where a large number of obstacles are present [130] .
