23 One of these compounds, namely, [Ru-(bphen) 2 dmbipy][PF 6 ] 2 (bphen = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, dmbipy = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, Figure 1 ), which has previously been described by others for its cytotoxic properties, 24 showed a great PDT potential on various cancer cell lines in a two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer model as well as in a three-dimensional (3D) HeLa multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model.
