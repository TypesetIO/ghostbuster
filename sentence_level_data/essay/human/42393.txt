An alternative explanation is that the (1; 11)(q42; q14.3) translocation causes the mutant allele of DISC1 transcript to be unstable and results in haploinsufficiency for DISC1 in the mutation carriers (Millar et al., 2005) .Our DISC1 (765-835) peptide targets both Ndel1 and Nde1, and it cannot differentiate the two dynein regulators due to their same binding properties.
