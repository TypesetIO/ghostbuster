The weights can be optimized and other agricultural lands should be considered to prove the effectiveness of the method (Suzuki et al., 2018) .The detection of citrus along with other crops' trees was performed by UAV through the implementation of a simple CNN model consisting of only one hidden layer (Csillik et al., 2018) .A research letter was published to show the significance of the Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for the task of land cover classification on the satellite images, found that one set of images achieved the highest accuracy by RF (LSTM) model while other datasets obtained best results by SVM (LSTM) model (Ienco et al., 2017) .Another research was conducted to classify satellite images of 11 different crops' land by RNN predominantly Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
