However, carbon materials produced from corn silk and coconut shells exhibited considerably different features (e.g., the number of inorganic impurities and surface area) despite using the same preparation process, thereby demonstrating different electrochemical performances (e.g., stable cyclic retention and high ICE) [148] .Consequently, the biomass composition considerably influences hard carbon characteristics and electrochemical performance.
