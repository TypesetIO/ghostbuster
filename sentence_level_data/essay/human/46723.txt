Another research was conducted to project the dynamics of forest cover by LSTMbased DL architecture, and relative explanatory variables to be included in future work and a robust deep learning model for different forest covers could be proposed (Ye et al., 2019) .A study proposed the 3D-VGG model to show its effectiveness for the classification of crops' lands from the images taken by two satellites (Ji et al., 2018) .In (Kussul et al., 2017) , a study presented the classification of various land cover types and crop types by the application of 1-D and 2-D CNNs for the first time specifically for the multisource satellite images, and the performance of CNNs was compared with RF and MLP.
