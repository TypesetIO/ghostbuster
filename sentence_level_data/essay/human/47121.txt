Although research on life skills development has been guided by Gould and Carson's (2008) operational definition (e.g., Camir√© et al., 2012) , the studies that focus on life skills transfer have not consistently been informed by a definition of life skills transfer that accounts for its complexities, and, thus, the depth of the research has been limited.
