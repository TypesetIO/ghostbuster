Especially medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) such as lauric (C 12 ) and myristic (C 14 ) acid (Soliva et al., 2004a) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) like linolenic acid (prevalent in linseed; Martin et al., 2008) were shown to be effective, but might also negatively influence feed intake and digestibility.
