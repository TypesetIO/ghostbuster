Similar findings have been made by Price et al. (1997 ), Fosso-Kankeu et al. (2015) , Karlsson and Kauppila (2016) and Karlsson et al. (2018a) .As the leachable concentrations of harmful elements in the single-addition NAG test decrease when the NAG test pH increases, high concentrations in NAG test leachate can only indicate elevated concentrations in drainage water under acidic NAG test conditions, as also stated by Barnes et al. (2015) .
