The three criteria were constant abundance (in blue; Ͻ1-log change in relative abundance throughout the year based on 16S rRNA genes shown in Fig. 3 ), constant activity (in yellow; Ͻ1-log change in relative abundance throughout the year based on 16S rRNA transcript shown in Fig. 3 ), and growth in activated sludge (in red; Ͼ1-log change in absolute abundance compared to influent wastewater as shown in Fig. 5 ).
