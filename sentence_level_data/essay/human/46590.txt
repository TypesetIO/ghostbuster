It was found that SVM classifiers (SVR and LS-SVM) outperformed other classifiers in terms of pixel-level Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) index and some future directions were provided in the article including the selection of input variables and the implication of fractional abundance constraints (Heremans & Van Orshoven, 2015) .For the land cover classification, three state-of-the-art methods were applied including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
