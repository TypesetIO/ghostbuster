The observation of more pronounced HR deceleration at higher skill levels has also been found in other sports, such as pistol shooting (Tremayne & Barry, 2001) , rifle shooting (Hatfield, Landers, & Ray, 1987) , and darts (Radlo, Steinberg, Singer, Barba, & Melnikou, 2002) , although it was not found in one study on archery (Salazar et al., 1990) . Lacey and Lacey's (1974, 1980) intake-rejection hypothesis provides a framework to explain the relationship between HR changes and motor skill performance.
