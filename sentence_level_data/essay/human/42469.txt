Massive losses of honey bee colonies and the decline of many bumblebee species have elicited global concern in recent decades (Lee et al., 2015; Hammer et al., 2021) .A large body of evidence suggests that gut microbiota is critical in maintaining bee health (Engel et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) .Previous studies have shown that honey bees and bumblebees harbor distinctive core gut bacterial communities that are transmitted through social behaviors such as oral trophallaxis and fecal-oral pathway (Khan et al., 2020; Hammer et al., 2021) .
