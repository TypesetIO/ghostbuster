Thermosensitive hydrogels, which undergo reversible bulk phase changes or sol-gel transitions in response to external temperature when used as a delivery vehicle for hydrophilic molecules. [5] herefore, there is an urgent need to design more efficient and stable transdermal delivery systems to expand the skin application of hydrophilic molecules.
