Under WGSR conditions, the cubic form (Pd/ CeO 2 −C) was more active than the octahedral form (Pd/ CeO 2 −O), and Cu doping increased the activity of both catalysts (activity: Pd/CDC−C > Pd/CeO 2 −C > Pd/CDC−O > Pd/CeO 2 −O).EXAFS, DRIFTS, and GA-DFT calculations showed that both the facet control and Cu doping increase D Pd .DFT calculations clarified that the increased D Pd on cube is attributed to the stronger binding of Pd to the (100) surface than to the (111) surface.
