Growing evidence suggests an instrumental role of reactive astrocytes in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, e.g. through the production of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic factors, altered phagocytic activity and far-reaching effects on synaptic connectivity [6, 7] .Astrocyte reactivity translates into modified cell morphology, changes in gene expression patterns and shifts in their physiological functions [8, 9] .By analogy to microglia, different functional subtypes of reactive astrocytes termed A1 and A2 have been previously described [10, 11] .Whereas some previous evidence suggested a potential beneficial impact of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease [12] , recent studies support an enrichment of C3 + potentially pro-inflammatory neurotoxic A1-like reactive astrocytes in a mouse model of AD-like amyloid pathology [13] and in post-mortem tissues from patients with AD [10] .
