When increasing the accuracy of risk and attributes, the author can use the analysis of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm, Na√Øve Bayes, and neural network.e accuracy is increased with a low number of attributes, which is possible by using various methods [15] .Prerana et al. predicted the risk level of probabilistic analysis and classification (PAC) and heart disease completed by machine learning technique.
