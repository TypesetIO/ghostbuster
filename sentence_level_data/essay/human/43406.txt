A comprehensive study on the characteristics of aerodynamic modification by tapering, set-back, helical twist, opening with varying shapes and combination of them, was recently made by Tanaka et al. 2012 . Kim et al. (2011b) tested 13 super tall building models with a typical building shape under an urban area flow to find the wind-induced response of these super tall buildings.
