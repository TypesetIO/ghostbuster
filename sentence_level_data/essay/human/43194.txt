Leiden mice develop NASH in the context of obesity, adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, and factors released by WAT under comparable experimental conditions used herein have been shown to contribute to NASH pathology. (43) Models with nonobese phenotypes such as methionine-choline deficient diet feeding, STZ treatment, or Pten deficiency (44) are typically more rapid, extreme, and liver-centric, and run the risk of underestimating the contributions of other organs.
