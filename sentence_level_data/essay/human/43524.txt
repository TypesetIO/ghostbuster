The operating variables chosen in the characterization of the modules were the evaporation channels inlet temperature (TEI), the condenser channels inlet temperature (TCI), and the feed flow rate (FFR), which have a strong influence on the performance of MD, according to several previous studies [13, 16] .TEI was kept around the setpoints of 60, 70 and 80 â€¢ C, the most common range used in pilot MD studies.
