Students working in collaboration are capable of solving more explorative tasks than students working on their own (Roschelle & Teasley, 1995) .Group work presents important opportunities for students to exhibit their different knowledge, skills, and abilities in learning settings and to realize the social interaction necessary for learning (Webel, 2013) .Therefore, the group work for this study is more appropriate, as it provides an environment in which students construct their mathematical knowledge.
