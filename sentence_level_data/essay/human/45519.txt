The present revival of the study of B cell suppression can be traced back to the observation that B-cell-deficient mice were unable to recover from experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (Wolf et al., 1996) .After this, three studies showing that B cells could suppress inflammation by the provision of IL-10 in models of colitis (Mizoguchi et al., 2002) , EAE (Fillatreau et al., 2002) , and arthritis (Mauri et al., 2003) were published.
