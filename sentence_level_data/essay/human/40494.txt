−22 For example, Jeong et al. prepared a kind of shell cross-linked micelles with a pH-labile ketal cross-linker based on the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)−poly(L-aspartic acid)−poly(L-phenylalanine) which showed a rapid Dox release triggered by endosomal pH. 19 ang and co-workers displayed another kind of boronate cross-linked micelles made from telodendrimer pair (PEG 5K -(nitroboronic acid/catechol) 4 -CA 8 ), and the stability of such CPMs was strongly interrupted by lowering the pH value from 7.4 to 5.0, leading to release of the encapsulated paclitaxel.
