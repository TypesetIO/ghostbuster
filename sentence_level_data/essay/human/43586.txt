Our activated sludge communities also did not contain any members of the genus Nitrospira (42) .While the Global Water Microbiome Consortium reported on the ubiquitous presence of Nitrospira in a global survey of WWTPs (4), the most abundant known nitrite oxidizers in the SBR samples in this study were Nitrotoga (0.2% Ϯ 0.2%) and Nitrobacter (0.3% Ϯ 0.2%) (43) .
