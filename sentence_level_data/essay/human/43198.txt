In addition, the serum metabolome has been shown to reflect the liver metabolome in two experimental NASH models. (11, 12) he serum metabolome also comprises metabolites processed and released by other organs, and therefore may provide clues to the contributions of other organs to NASH progression (such as the adipose tissue and the gut). (46, 47) Serum metabolomic profiles therefore form a comprehensive systemic characterization of subjects with NASH that may also allow more holistic treatment of systemic metabolic dysfunction.
