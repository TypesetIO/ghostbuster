The result is an increase in the qualifications needed even for low skills jobs as well as increasing proportions of highly skilled people taking those jobs (Felstead et al. 2002; Green and McIntosh 2002; Brynin 2002; Dolton and Vignoles 2000; Chevalier 2000) .In that respect, the educational 'human capital' calculation more than a rational calculation becomes a gamble in which winners will take it all, a kind of 'noo-kleptocracy' (from 'noo' (knowledge), 'klepto' (thief) and kratos (rule), where educated and fortunate winner/rulers can make large 'treasuries' their own, relatively independently of their productivity for society) or noo-tychocracy' (ruling of the lucky) rather than meritocracy.
