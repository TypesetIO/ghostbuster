Although traditionally poverty has been defined as the lack of income to meet basic human needs however, it is considered narrow definition of poverty and it is argued that monetary variables (such as income or expenditure) are unable to truly evaluate human well-being (Wang, 2016; Alkire et al., 2017; Idrees and Baig, 2017) .For this reason, Sen (1979) defines poverty as "capability deprivation" while Bourguignon and Chakravarty (2003) discuss that well-being depends on food, housing, clothing and availability of public goods.
