Nde1 and Ndel1 paralogs have been previously studied and show similar behaviors in cell cycle in non-neuronal cells (Stehman et al., 2007) .Recently, it was found that Nde1 and Ndel1 can substitute each other in many aspects of neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Bradshaw and Hayashi, 2017) .However, Nde1 also displays its unique roles in the cell-cycle progression of radial glial progenitors (Doobin et al., 2016) .
