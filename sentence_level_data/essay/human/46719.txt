An Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was implemented to classify land covers by Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and concluded that DCNN and FCN have substantially higher accuracy than other classifiers, and authors suggested that multi-view data taken from the UAS can work with the DNN without needing a huge amount of training data (Liu, Abd-Elrahman, et al., 2018; Liu, Zhang, et al., 2018) .To monitor forest cover, the CNN approach was adopted for the images taken from airborne and LiDAR.
