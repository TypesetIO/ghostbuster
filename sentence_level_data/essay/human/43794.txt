The programme was found to be effective in teaching the transfer of life skills through the comparison of First Tee programme participants with youth involved in other extracurricular activities and a three-year longitudinal design of programme participants (Weiss, Bolter, & Kipp, 2016) .While Weiss et al. (2014 Weiss et al. ( , 2016) ) have focused on the question of whether life skills transfer occurs, Allen, Rhind, and Koshy (2015) assessed the question of why life skills transfer occurs in a study focused on a sport-based life skills 'transfer-ability programme' which was developed to facilitate the learning and transfer of life skills.
