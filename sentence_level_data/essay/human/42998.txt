Studies have shown that these robotic cleaners can improve the efficiency of cleaning and monitoring by up to 30% compared to traditional cleaning methods [24, 25] .Moreover, the use of robotic cleaners reduces the risk of damage to the PV panels that can result from manual cleaning [26, 27] .Several studies have focused on the development of the robotic cleaners themselves, including their design and functionality.
