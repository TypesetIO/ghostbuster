In rugby union the number of possessions kicked and the numbers of errors made during a game can predict outcomes of close matches, (Vaz, Mouchet, Carreras, & Morente, 2011; Vaz, van Rooyen, & Sampaio, 2010) with around 32 kicks from hand remaining in play each game and therefore requiring fielding (Eaves, Hughes, & Lamb, 2005) .
