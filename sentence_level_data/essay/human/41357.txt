This result confirmed the symmetry analysis by Brews, who showed the rutile-to-monoclinic transition to be compatible with a phonon instability at the R-point [36] .Indeed, using a shell model to calculate the phonon dispersion of several rutile-type compounds, Gervais and Kress found a phonon softening at the tetragonal R-point for VO 2 [37] .Furthermore, the analysis of the eigenvectors of the R-point soft mode resulted in a displacement pattern of the metal atoms equivalent to that of the monoclinic phase [37] .
