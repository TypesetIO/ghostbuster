Accordingly, theory offers five practical benefits that include (1) the convenience of labels, (2) broader perspective when a study is modest in scope, (3) connection to a larger body of data that addresses concerns with generalization, (4) a critical perspective, and (5) disproof by providing negative cases (Wolcott, 1995) .As has been demonstrated above, researchers have differed in their views of how theory should be incorporated in qualitative research.
