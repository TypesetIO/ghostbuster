The hydrologic cycle is conditioned by the climate and provides moisture and energy inputs, such as daily precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperatures, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity, which control the water balance [16] .SWAT model can read these data directly from the files, and, if something is missing, it can be generated using the SWAT model generator.
