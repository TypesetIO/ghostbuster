Currently, the main types of energy-absorbing structures include honeycomb structures [1] [2] , thin-walled tubes [3] [4] , lattice structures [5] [6] , foam structures [7] [8] and biomimetic structures [9] [10] .Among them, the lattice structure is a relatively efficient energy absorbing material belonging to the energy absorbing structure, which is an ordered porous material with light weight [11] [12] , High strength ratio [13] and good energy absorption performance [14] .Li et al. [15] studied a wood-based two-dimensional positioning point lattice structure to optimize the wooden structure and improve its mechanical properties.
