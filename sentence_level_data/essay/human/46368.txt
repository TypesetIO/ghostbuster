.EGF receptors have an extracellular domain that binds to ligands, a α-helical transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain [9] .EGF receptors bind to specific ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), amphiregulin, epiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epigen which induce conformational changes, and convert inactive monomers to active homodimers/heterodimers [1]
