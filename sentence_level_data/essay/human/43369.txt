The terpenoid compounds commonly found in resin repel many predators [10, 14, 22, 61] .The predators (largely ants) that do attempt to advance across the resin droplets often become trapped in the sticky material [62] , and are only able to breech the barrier when they use the bodies of other ants to bridge the so-called resin "moat" [2, 63, 64] .Over time, the resin droplets harden, their adhesive and repellant properties likely diminish, and fresh stores must be applied [62, 65] .For some species (e.g., Trigona cilipes, Tetragonilla collina, and related species), the continuous application of fresh resin results in long, slender entrance tubes [10] .In the case of one remarkable species, nest entrance resin produces a dazzling architectural effect.
