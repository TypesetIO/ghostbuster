Despite the excellent hat transfer process under these conditions, transcritical cycles introduce high irreversibilities during the compression and expansion process penalising the COP of the cycle (Kim et al., 2004) .As a result, the classic vapour compression cycle adopted for artificial cold production is modified, and different arrangements are introduced to enhance the cycle's performance and reduce the heat rejection pressure.
