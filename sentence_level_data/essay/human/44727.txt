This is due to multiple factors including the lack of interdisciplinary research to inform testing and development of appropriate industrial-scale disinfection technologies commensurate with using bee infectivity colony studies (Goblirsch et al., 2021) ; the lack of a relevant in vitro bioassay for real-time determination of complex pathogen destruction that will inform appropriate treatment dosage (Simone-Fintrom et al., 2018) ; the variability in pathogen resistance to applied treatment technologies (Hidalgo et al., 2020) ; lack of simultaneous or sequential cellular and molecular information on the response of complex bee pathogens to sublethal and lethal treatment doses appropriate for killing pathogens in bee host (that maybe significantly lower dose when required for artificial in vitro disinfection studies (Naughton et al., 2017; Simone-Fintrom et al., 2018) ; and the lack of consensus on appropriate standard methods to reporting disinfection efficacy that includes future use of potential indicator reference strain(s) representative of different bee pathogen types informing comparative and repeatable studies enabling the relevant testing and development of appropriate breakthrough treatment technologies.
