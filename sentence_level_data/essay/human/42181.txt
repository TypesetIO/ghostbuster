Several authors have suggested a similar origin between tRNA and rRNA or mRNA (Bloch et al., 1984 (Bloch et al., , 1989;; Tamura, 2011; Root-Bernstein and Root-Bernstein, 2015, 2016) . Farias et al. (2014 Farias et al. ( , 2016a) ) suggested a new model for the origin of the biological systems, where the tRNA molecules orchestrated the initial organization of life.
