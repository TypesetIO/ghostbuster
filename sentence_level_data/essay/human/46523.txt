Most of the above studies found positive associations with PM exposure at some of the exposure lags studied, with the exception of Wang et al. (2014) . Cho et al. (2014) observed statistically significant positive associations of PM 10 exposure with ED attendance for depression at five of the six lags studied, whereas two studies (Szyszkowicz 2007; Szyszkowicz et al. 2009 ) both reported statistically significant positive associations between PM 10 and ED attendance for depression at some lags but were excluded from the meta-analysis (see Table S5 for details).
