LIPL-4 triggered nuclear translocation of LPB-8 (lysosomal lipid chaperone), thereby increasing longevity by activating NHR-49 and NHR-80 and regulating -9 desaturase expression (82) .Moreover, adding low amounts of glucose to C. elegans' diet shortens the life span of the worm by inhibiting the DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors (83) .In humans, high sugar content leads to excessive lipid accumulation and eventually causes obesity, diabetes, and heart disease (84, 85) .Supplementing the C. elegans diet with OA (ω-9, monounsaturated), AA (ω-6, polyunsaturated), and EPA (ω-3, polyunsaturated) influences both the reproduction and longevity of these animals (86) .Regarding the neural function of C. elegans, Watts (67) reported that 20carbon PUFAs are required for synaptic vesicle formation and accumulation, and both ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs perform the required cellular functions but they have different roles in neurologic processes; ω-3 fatty acids are specifically required for maintaining neuroplasticity.
