In a study involving linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), an analysis showed that physiological stress will allow commensal and pathogenic bacteria to enter extra intestinal sites, indicating the need for exploring the novel taxa [37, 38] .These extra intestinal sites would be circulating maternal blood microbiota in chick or in vivo colonies of microbes [37] .Apart from microbiota, some managemental practices like light intensity, drinking water, and flooring may also affect the incidence of BCO [39] .
