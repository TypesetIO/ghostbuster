Continuous evolution allowed the differential enrichment of the microbial members at each anatomical location, creating an organ-specific microbiota composition [1] .The gut microbiota is highly dense [4] and relatively the most studied microbial ecosystem [5] .The establishment and maturation of human gut microbiota initiate at birth and mature with age [6] .Though various genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors govern maturation [1, [6] [7] [8] , once matured, the core gut microbiota is highly resilient [6] .A matured gut microbiota is extremely diverse and with >50 bacterial phyla [8] with primary dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, followed by Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Fusobacteria [9] .
