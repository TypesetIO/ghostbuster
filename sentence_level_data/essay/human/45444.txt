On the contrary, Frutosbencze et al. (2017) studied the data of member states of Central American Free Trade Agreement from 1979 to 2010, and found that the new technologies provided by FDI improved the production efficiency for less developed countries, and stimulated the clean or green production, thereby reducing the emissions of SO 2 , NO x and CO 2 . Huang (2018) used the spatial Durbin model and China's panel provincial data from 2008 to 2013, and the results showed that SO 2 emissions decreased over time with increases in FDI.
