One effective strategy is to incorporate drug-carrying colloids (e.g., particles, nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles) into hydrogel three-dimensional matrices to form colloid-hydrogel composite systems. [5, 7] Among these colloids, liposomes are particularly attractive due to their cellular affinity, low immunogenicity and biocompatibility, as well as their ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules, making them a versatile drug delivery platform.
