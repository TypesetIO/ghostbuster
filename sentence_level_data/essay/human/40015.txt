The correlation between change in axial length and progression of myopia, documented in randomized clinical trials, is also quite high, ranging between 0.77 and 0.89 [35, 36] .The CLEERE (Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error) study demonstrated that myopic children had longer axial lengths than did emmetropes before and after the onset of myopia (3 years before through 5 years after), with the fastest rate of change in axial length occurring during the year before rather after onset [37] .
