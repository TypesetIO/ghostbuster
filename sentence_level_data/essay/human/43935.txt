Although the previous studies have shown a greater or similar lesion diameter and volume with high power-short RF applications, 9, 18 90 W/4 s RF applications in the present study were associated with lower tissue temperatures and smaller lesion size (depth, diameter, and volume) in both thigh muscle preparations and beating hearts (Figures 2, 4, 5, and 7; Table I in the Data Supplement).
