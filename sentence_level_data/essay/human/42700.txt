Some of these drawbacks have been addressed to yield second-generation PSs (e.g., Photosens, Foscan, Laserphyrin, Redaporphin, Photogem, Radachlorin, Purlytin, Lutrin, TOOKAD soluble) with betterdefined structures, improved aqueous solubility, longer absorption wavelengths, and reduced skin sensitization.
