Nor et al. used acoustic emission method to analyze the crack types of concrete specimens under stress and the results showed that AF and RA methods can be successfully applied to determine the crack types and tendencies [59] .Farhidzadeh et al. found that tensile fractures in fracture cement release higher RA and lower AF values than shear fractures [60, 61] .
