To better elucidate this aspect, G out at the time of the main heat flow peak, when the rate of reaction is at its maximum, is plotted as a function of the initial water activity [Fig. 10(c)] .For a H0 = 1, the best-fit values of G out are 0.050 and 0.054 lm/h for pastes prepared at l/s = 0.45 and 0.65, respectively.
