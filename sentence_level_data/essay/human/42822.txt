Recent data from our laboratory showed that disruption of protein synthesis in the amygdala immediately following trace fear conditioning impairs consolidation of CS and context memories (Kwapis et al., 2011) .The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has also been implicated in trace fear memory processes (Baeg et al., 2001; Blum, Hebert, & Dash, 2006; Gilmartin & McEchron, 2005b; Runyan, Moore, & Dash, 2004) and we have shown that the prelimbic (PL) area of the mPFC is necessary for trace, but not delay, fear conditioning (Gilmartin & Helmstetter, 2010) .Temporary inactivation of PL with the GABA A agonist muscimol or temporary inhibition of prelimbic NMDA receptors with APV prior to training impaired the formation of CS and context memory for trace, but not delay, fear conditioning (Gilmartin & Helmstetter, 2010) .
