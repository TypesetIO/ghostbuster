Titanium, Germanium, Palladium and Platinum Pinnularia sp., a rod-shaped diatom, was used as a platform for the biological manufacturing of a silica-titania (Si-TiO 2 ) composite material in which nanosized TiO 2 was inserted physiologically [59] .Diatom frustules-TiO 2 composites have been extensively studied and utilized in recent years to improve dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) efficiency [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] .
