The evolution of nuclear magnetization for an uncoupled population of spin-half nuclei can be described by the Bloch equations, 13, 14 where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio; T 1 and T 2 are the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times, respectively; M(r,t) = M x (r,t)i + M y (r,t)j + M z (r,t)k is the macroscopic magnetization density of the population, where i, j and k are unit vectors in the x-, y-and z-directions, respectively; B(t) is the magnetic field -typically this is of the form B(r,t) = (B 0 + G(t)•r)k + B rf cos(ω rf t + ϕ)i where B 0 is the strength of the main magnetic field and, if a gradient is present, its magnitude and direction are given by G(t) (r denotes the position of the nuclear population); B rf is the magnitude of the rf pulse (and is significantly smaller than B 0 ), ω rf is its frequency and ϕ is its phase.
