Light intensity is directly related to the bird movement and activity which may affect the incidence of BCO [40] [41] [42] [43] , and a study showed that detecting surface temperatures of broiler leg regions with the help of non-invasive methods would also help in detecting lesions of BCO [44] .In two different studies, provision of 25-OH vitamin D3, prophylactic administration of probiotics were reported to abate the incidence of BCO in wire flooring model which were attributed to trigger the lameness in broilers [34, 45] (Figure 2 ).directly related to the bird movement and activity which may affect the incidence of BCO [40] [41] [42] [43] , and a study showed that detecting surface temperatures of broiler leg regions with the help of non-invasive methods would also help in detecting lesions of BCO [44] .In two different studies, provision of 25-OH vitamin D3, prophylactic administration of probiotics were reported to abate the incidence of BCO in wire flooring model which were attributed to trigger the lameness in broilers [34, 45] (Figure 2 ).
