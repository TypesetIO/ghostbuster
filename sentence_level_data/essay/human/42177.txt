These motifs are in proximity to the catalytic site that is responsible for the binding of substrates and cofactors (Oreilly and Kao, 1998; Ng et al., 2008) .With the discovery of the catalytic function of RNA molecules (Kruger et al., 1982; Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983) , it was suggested that RNA had the dual role of storing biological information in their sequences, and they also acted as catalysts, which were crucial for the biological systems in formation (Gilbert, 1986) .
