Biomass with high lignin content results in high biochar and hydrochar yield (Guo et al., 2016) .Antal and Grønli investigated the effect of lignin content on biochar yield and have found that the lignin-rich biomass (pine wood and spruce wood) resulted in biochar with higher yield (Antal and Grønli, 2003) .The higher heating value (HHV) of both carbonaceous materials also depends on the feedstock.
