The primary goal for orbital reconstruction is to repair the fractured wall by restoring skeletal cavity, orbital volume, function and aesthetics (Bartoli et al., 2015; Gabrielli et al., 2011; Pagnoni et al., 2014) .Imageguidance technology is often used for the design of customised orbital implants, especially in case of irregular defects, significant bone losses or fractures involving two orbital walls such as floor and medial wall (Bittermann et al., 2014; Susarla et al., 2015; Wyle_ zo≈Ç et al., 2015) .
