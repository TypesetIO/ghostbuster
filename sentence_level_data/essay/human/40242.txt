Nevertheless, according to the symmetry considerations pointed out e.g. by Paquet and Leroux-Hugon, the zigzag-type shift is still coupled to the vertical metal-metal pairing, The previous observation and especially the different behaviour of the two dioxides has strong implications for our understanding of the whole class of materials.
