Most of them were devoted to single phase systems (Jaworski and Dudczak, 1998; Osman and Varley, 1999; Jaworski et al., 2000; Do et al., 2001; Bujalski et al., 2002a Bujalski et al., , 2002b;; Murthy Shekhar and Jayanti, 2002; Montante and Magelli, 2004; Montante et al., 2005; Kukukova et al., 2005; Mostek et al., 2005; Javed et al., 2006; Kumaresan and Joshi, 2006; Ochieng et al., 2008; Coroneo et al., 2011) , and very few were focused on multiphase (gas-liquid and solid-liquid) stirred reactors (Khopkar et al., 2006b; Jahoda et al., 2009; Kasat et al., 2008) .From the above survey, it is noted that nearly all the simulation works used the standard k−ε model to handle turbulence.
