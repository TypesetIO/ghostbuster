This behavioral test was developed by the late Arthur Benton in the context of clinical and experimental studies of prosopagnosia-that is, a rare, specific and massive impairment at individual face recognition following brain damage (Bodamer, 1947; Quaglino & Borelli, 1867 ; see Busigny, Mayer, & Rossion, 2013 , for a review), as well as of impairments at unfamiliarface matching in groups of patients with posterior brain damage (Benton & Van Allen, 1968 , 1972; De Renzi, Faglioni, & Spinnler, 1968; Tzavaras, Hécaen, & Le Bras, 1970 ; see also Milner, 1968) .The BFRT consists of matching grayscale photographs of individual (Caucasian) faces: First, participants should match one target face appearing at the top to one of six faces presented simultaneously below (six items), and then match one target face to three of the six faces below (16 items) (Fig. 1 ), for a total score of 54 [i.e., (6 × 1) + (16 × 3)].
