Some examples are the flash-gas by-pass valve (Elbel and Hrnjak, 2004, Cabello et al., 2012) , the parallel compressor (Chesi et al., 2014) , ejectors (Haida et al., 2016 , Singh et al., 2020) , or the adoption of active subcooling systems at the exit of the gas-cooler (Bellos and Tzivanidis, 2019 , SÃ¡nchez et al., 2020 , Aranguren et al., 2021) .However, excepting the IHX, these methods increase the cost of the plant and its complexity, so most of them are only targeted to large-capacity systems as centralized systems.
