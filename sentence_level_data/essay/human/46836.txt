Bindels et al. investigated the use of this technology in the batch concentration of RO brines at a large scale combined with other membrane technologies, and performed an economic analysis to estimate the corresponding levelized cost of water of each alternative [36] .Soon after, theoretical setups of V-AGMD fed with a heat pump were analysed [37] .
