Our findings suggest that similar to other markets in India as well most consumers evaluate a foreign product based on its price and quality while the manufacturing country does not often determine their choice (Elliot & Cameron, 1994) .A previous study conducted on Indian consumers showed that ethnocentrism and COO significantly determine their purchase intention of foreign products, besides price and quality (Bamber, Phadke, & Jyotishi, 2012) .For Indians, purchasing foreign brands has been associated with superior technology, quality, and status (Batra et al., 2000; Kinra, 2006) , and brands are valued more than their country of production (Jin et al., 2006) .We found that among Indians quality of Chinese commodities is never rated high and preferences are determined by their price and features mainly, along with brand recognition.
