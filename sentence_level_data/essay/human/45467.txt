The mechanical properties of human trabecular bone, which our porous structure intends to mimic, range between 10-3200 MPa and 4-24 MPa for the modulus of elasticity and the yield strength, respectively (Gibson et al., 2010) .Consequently, to obtain a porous structure that is at least 3.5 times stronger than the trabecular bone, while offering the largest possible room for bone ingrowth, a porosity Ï† of 58% is required, which now leads to an apparent modulus of elasticity (E*) of 8.4 GPa and a yield strength (S Y *) of 91 MPa.
