In a study performed by Fayanju et al. in 20,265 patients treated with NAC, and a median follow-up of 3.0 years, having ypN+ disease also resulted in a statistically significant worse 5-year OS compared to ypN0 in both patients with cN0 disease (86.0%versus 95.0%, p < 0.0001), and those with cN1 disease (80.0%versus 94.0%, p < 0.0001) [10] .
