Texture features of weed species have been applied for distinguishing weed species with grass and broadleaf classification accuracies of 93% and 85%, respectively [125] .Textural image analysis was used to detect weeds in the grass [126] .Gabor wavelet features of NIR images of apples were extracted for quality inspection and used as input to kernel PCA [127] .Kernel PCA first maps the nonlinear features to linear space and then PCA is applied to separate the image Gabor wavelet (5 scales and 8 orientations) combined with kernel PCA had the highest recognition rate (90.5%).
