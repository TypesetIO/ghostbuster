Equations ( 6)e(8) were used to calculate COV [46] .E (1) calculates BP (brake power), n (engine speed), and T (torque) in kW, rpm, and Nm, respectively.E (2) calculates BSFC, m l (liquid fuel mass flow) and m h (Hydrogen flow rate) in g/kWh, kg/h, and kg/h, respectively.E (3) calculates BTE, LHV l (liquid fuel lower heating value), and LHV h (Hydrogen lower heating value) based on the fuel used.E (4) calculates HRR (heat release rate) in J/ CA, with g, q, P, V representing specific heat ratio, crank angle, cylinder pressure (in bar), and cylinder volume (in cm 3 ), respectively.
