The stimuli used are also well controlled, since they do not have external features such as hair or obvious cues (facial hair, glasses, etc.) , and yet the overall shape of the faces, which plays a key role in human expertise at unfamiliar-face recognition (e.g., Retter & Rossion, 2015) , is well preserved.
