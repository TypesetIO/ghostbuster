These enzymes also participate in several biological processes in eukaryotes, such as amplification of microRNAs (Alquist, 2002) , which are involved in the control of the genetic expression, on the development of nematodes, and in protecting plants against pathogenic agents (Iyer et al., 2003; Zong et al., 2009) .
