For example, the tannin extract from Acacia mearnsii was shown to significantly decrease CH 4 emission in sheep and cows (Carulla et al., 2005; Grainger et al., 2009) .As proposed by Tavendale et al. (2005) , tannins may have a direct effect on methanogens and an indirect effect on hydrogen production due to a lower level of feed degradation.
