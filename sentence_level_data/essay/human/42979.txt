At the national level, Laos achieves sectoral development goals through reserved land for the construction of SEZs [17] .At the local level, the encouragement of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Laos has resulted in certain SEZs occupying original planned protected land and urban green land areas, thus affecting the implementation of local land-use planning [18] .At the SEZ level, Chen et al. [19] analyzed the land development income mode of the Saysettha Development Zone, a representative Chinese International Cooperation Park in Laos, and found that the SEZ realized land appreciation mainly through land leasing and selling and provided basic supporting services.
