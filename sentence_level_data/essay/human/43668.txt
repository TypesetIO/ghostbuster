Liposomes possess a phospholipid bilayer structure that is similar to biological membranes, and their controlled particle size and surface properties allow them to effectively penetrate the skin barrier and enhance the absorption of functional factors in the skin. [9, 10] Moreover, studies have shown that liposomes tend to remain in the epidermal layer of the skin, which could maximize the retention of functional factors in the skin, thus becoming the preferred for epidermal delivery. [11] iposomes in liquid form face drawbacks of instability and rapid clearance on the skin. [12]
