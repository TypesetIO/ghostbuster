We did not undertake meta-analysis of associations of short-term PM exposure with these outcomes due to the heterogeneity of the time lags analyzed and a lack of numeric reporting of unstratified results in two studies of ED attendances, meaning that-for each lag considered-there were fewer than three studies using the same exposure lags.
