In this scenario, energy in cities must be better managed, and the cities' design must be optimized (Reinhart & Cerezo Davila, 2016) .Thus, numerous urban building energy modeling (UBEM) methodologies and tools have been developed (Nageler et al., 2018) .They provide users with the energy demand of the building stock, comprehending benchmarking analyses, scenarios evaluation, peak loads and energy patterns analysis, and other peculiar analyses (Swan & Ugursal, 2009) .UBEM is different from the other two approaches used to model the urban environment: land-use/transport analyses (reference tools are UrbanSim (Waddell & Borning, 2004; Waddell, 2000; Waddell et al., 2003) , OPUS (Waddell, Ševčíková, Miller, Nagel, & Socha, 2005) , ILUTE (Salvini & Miller, 2005) and ALBATROSS (Arentze & Timmermans, 2004 )) and urban system energy modeling (USEM).
