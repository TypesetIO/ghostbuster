Instead of plumbing popular cultural texts or articulating them to other texts in search of a hidden or previously unseen meaning (a hermeneutics), newer approaches to studying popular phenomena have tended to focus on the movement and flow of power, objects, or even logics, within global networks, within social imaginaries, and among populations, publics, and counterpublics (Asen, 2000; Greene, 1998) .Owing to the universalization of the popular and the consequent focus on form described above, it is no surprise that "circulation" and "circuit" are central tropes of this strain of theory, which has developed from a number of poststructural bases: Foucauldian and Deleuzian approaches to culture, public sphere studies, and cultural studies (see Greene, 1999 Greene, , 2004;; Grossberg, 1992, pp. 37-87; Johnson, 1996, pp. 80-85; Warner, 2002, pp. 90-96) .
