Factor 1 of PM 2.5 was interpreted as industrial emissions and dust/crustal re-suspension at Ari having high Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Al, Ti, Cr, Mn, As, and Ni loadings, as shown in Table 4a .At Din Daeng, factor 1 represents industrial emissions and dust re-suspension with high loadings of Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Ti, Mn, Ni, and As.In contrast, at Bangna, factor 1 is highly loaded with OC, EC, NH 4 + , K + , NO 3 − , SO 4 2− , Cl − , and Fe, which represent primary combustion sources, including vehicle emissions, biomass burning, coal combustion, and secondary aerosol formation.
