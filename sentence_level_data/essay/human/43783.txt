Considering the fact that the effect of nanoparticles on soil depends on various factors such as the purity of the nano-materials, laboratory conditions and the temperature and type of soil, the experimental conditions used in the research presented here (e.g.type of soil, type of nano-materials and laboratory tests) different from those of previous studies.
