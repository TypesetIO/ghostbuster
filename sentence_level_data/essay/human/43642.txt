Many studies that used the HLE as a construct for predicting children's development have shown that its quality influences children's cognitive and socioemotional development (Kluczniok & Mudiappa, 2019) by examining the relationship between the HLE and children's educational outcomes, especially for literacy and numeracy (Kluczniok et al., 2013) .Research has shown the potential effect of the HLE on language (Boyce et al., 2013) and reading skills (Foster et al., 2005) .Formal and informal literacy experiences (Sénéchal & LeFevre, 2002) phonemic awareness, improved vocabulary skills and knowledge of concepts about print (Tamis-Le Monda et al., 2019) are positively associated with children's literacy development (Hayes & Berthelsen, 2020) .Similarly, the home numeracy environment (HNE) influences the development of early mathematical skills (Anders et al., 2012) .Studies about emerging numeracy have examined different aspects of the HLE and HNE like playing board games, identifying shapes (Skwarchuk, 2009) , practicing in comparing quantities (Purpura & Lonigan, 2013) and doing activities that extend early numeracy concepts (LeFevre et al., 2009) .
