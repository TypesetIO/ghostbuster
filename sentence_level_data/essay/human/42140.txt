Whenever possible, researchers should use an undetectable substance (Tobajas et al., 2019a; Pebsworth and Radhakrishna, 2020) , such as the fungicide thiram (Table 2 ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) that has been shown to be undetectable by domestic dogs and wild foxes (Tobajas et al., 2020a,c) .Nevertheless, <5% of field experiments explicitly reports using either a resinate, micro-encapsulation or thiram (one experiment for each; Supplementary Data 1).
