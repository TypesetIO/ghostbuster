(2003) reported using economic experiments that Indian students are strongly inequality averse when choosing from behind a veil of ignorance, with around one fifth choosing income distributions closest to Rawlsian notion of equality, which is in line with previous results from Sweden by Johansson-Stenman et al. (2002) (cf.also Becker and Miller 2009) .
