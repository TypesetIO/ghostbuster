Autophosphorylation of tyrosines within the regulatory tail at the c-termini of the receptors is required for downstream signaling [2, 10] .HER2 amplification and overexpression are often detected in cancer and have been shown to contribute to tumor development [11] .HER2/HER3 hetero-dimerization has also been shown to be important for cancer development [12, 13] .HER3 does not have the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and hence needs to dimerize with other HER family members to induce downstream signaling [14] .
