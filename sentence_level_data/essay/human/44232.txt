Thus, if we are interested only in the evolution of the transverse magnetization under delays and gradients (and also under 180° pulses), the transverse components of Equation 2 can be written in complex form by defining M(r,t) = M x (r,t) + iM y (r,t) and noting, where ω 0 = -γB 0 (ie, the Larmor frequency) and we have eliminated the x and y directions since we can assume M is only a function of z and t.By making the replacement M → Mexp(iω rf t), Equation 3 becomes, where ω rf is the precession frequency of the rotating reference frame (this can be any frequency we like).
