Most people don't know this but an itch is just a mild signal to your pain receptors, something brushes against your body and your pain receptors send an itching signal to your brain, scratching dislodges the irritant and you go on with your life, not me though, through some strange twist in biology the signal never stops I just itch and itch and itch ad infinitum.
