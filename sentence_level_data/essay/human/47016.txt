Fatty foods require protection from light and oxygen to prevent lipid oxidation and consequent deterioration of food quality and safety (Mestdagh et al., 2005) .Therefore, the choice of packaging materials must consider the mechanical resistance and barrier to water vapor and oxygen (Pires et al., 2021) , as well as the storage temperature and humidity conditions (Chen et al., 2019) .These protections are often achieved through non-biodegradable petroleum-based plastic packaging.
