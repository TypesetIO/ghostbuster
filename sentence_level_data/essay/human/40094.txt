Alternatives to conventional microscopy for schistosomiasis diagnosis include the urine-based point-of-care test to detect circulating cathodic antigens and the up-converting particle lateral flow assay to detect circulating anodic antigens in either serum or urine (Corstjens et al., 2020; Hoekstra et al., 2021) .Nucleic acid amplification tests, which involve the detection of parasite's specific nucleic acid sequences, have been used to detect STH and schistosome infections, although mainly in research settings (Obeng et al., 2008; Meurs et al., 2015; Sanprasert et al., 2019) .
