For example, the classification among agricultural lands was performed and compared by implementing DT, RF, and SVM and it was concluded that object-based SVM got the highest Overall accuracy (Duro et al., 2012) .A research was conducted to classify 16 classes divided into ten agricultural and six non-agricultural landscapes; a comprehensive comparison was provided between six state-of-the-art ML techniques including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), the Least-Squares (LS)-SVM, Bagged Regression Trees (BaRTs), Boosted Regression Trees (BoRTs), and the Random Forest (RF) by using EPR-(Eenmalige perceels registratie-in the Dutch language) based data and CORINE Land-Cover 2006 dataset.
