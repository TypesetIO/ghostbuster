Consistent with this model, the expression of DISC1 mutant , both in iPSCs derived from patients and in HEK293 heterologous cells, can cause stability decrease of WT DISC1 (Wen et al., 2014) .In contrast, the t(1; 11)(q42; q14.3) translocation-induced mutation deletes a large part of the tetramerization domain in addition to the Ndel1-binding region.
