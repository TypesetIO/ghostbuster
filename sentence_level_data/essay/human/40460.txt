Some results in AR research point out that consumers value utilitarian benefits the most (e.g., Dacko, 2016) .However, in some cases, the hedonic value of a VTO tool is a stronger cause for adoption than its utilitarian value (e.g., Kim and Forsythe, 2008) .Moreover, some results suggest that the hedonic value of an AR-based VTO tool is a stronger predictor of consumer's behavioral intentions than the utilitarian value (Javornik et al., 2016) .
