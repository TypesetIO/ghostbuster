For the two models of Pd 8 /CeO 2 (111) + V O and Pd 8 /CDC(100) + V O without and with surface atom control (Cu doping and facet control), respectively, additional OH surf was made by adsorbing additional H atoms on O latt sites, each of which is located at the most stable adsorption site (Figure S34 ).
