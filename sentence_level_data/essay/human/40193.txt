We present two algorithms for the approsimoto vemion that significantly improve the known bounds: (a) prcprocessing cost polynomial in n and d, and a truly nublinear query time (for B > 1); and, (b) query time polynomial in log n and d, and only a mildly exponential preprocessing cozt O(n) x 0(1/~)~.tither, by applying a classical geomet,ric lemma on random projections (for which we give a eimplcr proof), we obtain the first known algorithm with polynomial preprocessing and query time polynomial in d and log n.
