Several studies have demonstrated the utilitarian and hedonic value of online shopping technologies in general (e.g., Childers et al., 2001) and VTO tools in particular (e.g., Dacko, 2016; Javornik et al., 2016; Kim and Forsythe, 2008; Merle et al., 2012; Yim et al., 2017) .In the case of AR-based applications, positive behavioral responses such as purchase intention or intention to return arise from increased utilitarian and hedonic value perceptions of the AR experience (e.g., Hilken et al., 2017; Javornik et al., 2016) .Research on VTO tools and AR applications should address the relative importance of utilitarian and hedonic value in predicting and explaining consumers' responses (Javornik, 2016a) .
