However, although there were no significant differences in stride length (Fig. 4c ) or stride time (Fig. 4d ) before and soon after grafting, by 7 weeks after graft apposition, ChABC-treated animals had significantly longer stride lengths (Fig. 4c ) (200 Ϯ 43 mm; p ϭ 0.032) and stride times (Fig. 4d ) (1508 Ϯ 225 ms; p ϭ 0.034) compared with PBS-treated animals (stride length, 109 Ϯ 15 mm; stride time, 952 Ϯ 126 ms).
