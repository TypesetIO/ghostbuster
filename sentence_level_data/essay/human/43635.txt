The frequency of deaths attributed to pneumonitis in this trial was consistent with the frequency previously observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC. 12, 14, 20 n conclusion, in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to induction therapy with pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug and to pemetrexed maintenance therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival and a higher response rate than the addition of placebo at a cost of a low incidence of renal dysfunction at the first interim analysis.
