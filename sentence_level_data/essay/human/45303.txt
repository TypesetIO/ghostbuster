Because C. elegans' body does not have blood vessels, the roles of PUFAs can be studied independently of their inflammatory functions (67) .Furthermore, the impacts of specific fatty acids on life span and aging processes in C. elegans were recently evaluated (78, 79) .Previous studies have demonstrated that synthesis of PUFA-derived mediators (F-series prostaglandins) in this worm is mediated by insulin signaling in the intestine and TGF-β signaling in sensory neurons to ensure the process of reproduction (67, 80) .Furthermore, dietary supplementation of dihomoγ -linolenic acid (DGLA; 20:3ω-6) resulted in sterility associated with germ cell death due to apoptosis, caused by production of specific epoxy-and hydroxyl-toxic metabolites through the activity of CYP-33E2, one of the major isoforms of the cytochrome-P450 protein family, involved in the production of long-chain fatty acid metabolites (81) .On the contrary, high amounts of EPA-rich fish oil intake did not affect C. elegans' fertility (71).
