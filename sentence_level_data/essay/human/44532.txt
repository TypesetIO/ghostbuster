Eight landmarks were measured, annotated in the magnified view at the bottom of the section (1) the cortex plus corpus callosum (CC) length was approximated using the vertical intensity profile of the contrast enhanced grayscale image; (2) the hippocampus height was calculated in the vertical direction, after the "peak point" between CA1 and CA2 was located; (3) the length of the hippocampus was calculated as the arc length of the pyramidal cell layer; (4) the local curve change at the "peak point" between CA1 and CA2 was captured by the radius of the best locally fit circle to the curve (in cyan); (5) similarly, the local curve change of CA3 was captured by the radius of the best locally fit circle; (6) the length of the colored DG segment was calculated as the arc lengths of the corresponding granular cell layer; (7) the DG height was measured vertically, after locating the peak point between the top and bottom granular cell layers; (8) the DG apex was captured by the radius of the best locally fit circle to the DG line.
