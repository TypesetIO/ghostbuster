The application of computeraided design and additive manufacturing for the production of patient-specific medical prostheses and implants, to reconstruct facial and orbital bones defects, has been described in several papers (Hieu et al., 2003; Peel et al., 2016; Salmi et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2011) .To date, surgeons have four main choices for the reconstruction of orbital walls, but some drawbacks are evident in each of them, as summarised in Table I .The first procedure cannot guarantee an accurate definition of implant geometry and positioning, resulting in long surgical time and trauma for periorbital tissues caused by the unavoidable repetitive trial fitting of the implant.
