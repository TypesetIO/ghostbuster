Commonly, any combination of in situ measurements, land surface model estimates, active-microwave-based retrievals, or passive-microwavebased retrievals is expected to fulfil this requirement because their sources of errors are assumed to be mostly independent (Gruber et al., 2016a) , provided that neither of them has been used to generate another (e.g., by assimilating satellite data in to a land surface model; Reichle et al., 2017a Reichle et al., , 2017b)) .
