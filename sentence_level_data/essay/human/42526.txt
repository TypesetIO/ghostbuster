It has been shown that, in the absence of spinspin interactions, spin relaxation can only occur through the modulation of the spin Hamiltonian by local rotations and intramolecular distortions (14) .However, for a spin 1/2 in reasonable external fields, the Zeeman spin splitting (up to a few cm âˆ’1 ) is much smaller than Fig. 2 . Spin relaxation time as function of the B field for one electronic spin coupled to one nuclear spin.
