A gradient elution was performed by varying the proportion of solvent A (ultra-pure waterorthophosphoric acid pH 2.6, 99.99:0.01v/v) to solvent B (acetonitrile) with a flow rate of 1 mL min âˆ’1 .The gradient started at 5% B and went up linearly to 30% B 14 min post injection (MPI), then to 90% B 24 MPI, and remained isocratic for 5 min before returning to initial conditions 31 MPI.
