Recent research has suggested that when performers seek to make decisions under pressure they are governed by goal driven heuristics which lead them to select the first solution that they think will be successful (Johnson & Raab, 2003; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993) . Klein (1997) reported that experts across a number of domains (military, aviation, fire service, space exploration) make effective decisions, in their specific context, without lengthy consideration of all the options available to them.
