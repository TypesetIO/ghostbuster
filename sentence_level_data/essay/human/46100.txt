Here are some examples of alternate selectors: $("p > a"); // selects anchors that are direct children of paragraphs $("input[type=text]"); // selects inputs that have specified type $("a:first"); // selects the first anchor on the page $("p:odd"); // selects all odd numbered paragraphs $("li:first-child"); // selects each list item that's the first child in its list jQuery also allows the use of its own custom selectors.
