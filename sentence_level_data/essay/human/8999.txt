It started with one long slow note,
Was apprehensive at the start,
With confidence the note grew bolder,
Adding harmonies to its heart,
As song took shape more voices joined,
â€˜ Till the village was filled with song,
And I alone ignored its pleading,
I had no voice to sing along,
I looked down on the songs and dancing,
My lip curled with righteous scorn,
"What childishness this frivolous drear,
Too carefree for one wellborn,"
