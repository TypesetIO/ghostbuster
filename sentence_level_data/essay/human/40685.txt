One meta-analysis of three RCTs investigating various selective PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil 50 mg twice daily, modified-release sildenafil 100 mg/day increased up to 200 mg/ day or tadalafil 20 mg on alternate days) in patients with SSc-RP of whom 39 had baseline DUs indicated that selective PDE-5 inhibitors improved healing of DUs in patients with SSc. 38 lthough DUs healing was a co-primary outcome only in one of three RCTs included into the meta-analysis, and all three RCTs were underpowered to detect difference between active treatment and placebo, the pooled effect shows significant benefit of PDE-5 inhibitors over placebo on DUs healing.
