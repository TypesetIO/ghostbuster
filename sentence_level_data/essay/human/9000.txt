As hours passed the song had changed,
For with each precious moment,
A fresh new song had been arranged,
Thus began my painful torment,
For I alone could hear no song,
Nor the cadence in the dance,
Nor the words with which the village crooned,
To lovers locked in their romance,
A different song for love or weeping,
For ending conflicts long hard-fought,
Though animals with growls and peeping,
Could hear the Song, I alone could not,
I begged my ears to hear the sound,
My voice to produce a single note,
Yet heard no Song and no note found,
The lines I was unable to quote,
Desperate now with tears and pleading,
Arms stretched skyward, knees shorn and bleeding,
"From whence came these tragic proceedings,
