It is also plausible that FKBP51 regulates the functions of other protein via its isomerase activity and its involvement in the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and lipidation of proteins [60, 61] .Importantly, we identified that the Parkin Ser65 residue is critical for FKBP51 and Parkin interaction, and that Ser65 phosphorylation is associated with disease onset.
