Pan-Tompkins's algorithm for recognition of R-peak, discrete orthogonal Stockwell transform (DOST) for extraction of features in ECG signal in addition to support vector machines (SVMs) for classification for automatic cardiac arrhythmia beat classification, the parameters are modified using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique are among those algorithms used in this method.
