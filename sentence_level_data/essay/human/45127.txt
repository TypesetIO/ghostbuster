In addition to the observed reduction in the level of collagen in the liver in the present study, OCA also lowered the degree of reticulation of collagen (of both thin and aggregated collagen fibers) as assessed by multiphoton imaging, a technology that allows the dissection of fibrosis stages in human biopsies. (53) Because hepatic fibrosis is the result of an imbalance between the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, (54) any effect on hepatic fibrosis can be explained by an effect on either (or both) of these processes.
