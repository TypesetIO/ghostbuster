Many studies have demonstrated that some CTA emetics can be detected by animals (Burns, 1980; Ellins and Martin, 1981; Massei et al., 2003; Catry and Granadeiro, 2006) , which can severely hamper the intervention because the animals associate the more salient stimulus (i.e., the emetic and not the food) with the illness (Conover, 1984; Cagnacci et al., 2005) .
