Jesus illustrates this through a short example, “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish – lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish’” (New International Version, 2011, Luke 14:28-30).
