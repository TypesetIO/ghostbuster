Behavioral evidence supporting face-speciÂ®c mechanisms has been provided by studies showing that stimulus inversion disrupts the processing of faces more than other objects (the face inversion effect) [1] , and that individual feature recognition in faces is particularly dependent upon the relationships between features (the face superiority effect) [2] .
