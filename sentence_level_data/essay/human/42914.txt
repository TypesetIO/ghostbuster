Among insects, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are of great relevance for humans, and the ecosystems, not only as honey producers but especially as pollinators of agricultural and horticultural crops and of wild plants (Batra 1995; Dedej and Delaplane 2003) .In a recent review, Klein et al. (2007) reported that most of the major crops for global food production are strictly dependent on animal pollination or are greatly favoured by pollinators, in terms of fruit size, quality and quantity.
