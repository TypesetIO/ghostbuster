1 Intensity plays a crucial part within the World Health Organization 2020 PA guidelines, which recommend adults participate in a minimum of 150 minutes per week moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week vigorous-intensity PA. 2 Self-reported activity reflects perceived intensity of effort, 3 thus likely aligning with relative intensity, while accelerometer-assessed activity usually aligns with absolute intensity.
