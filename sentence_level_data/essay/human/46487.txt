Breslow (1972) demonstrated that the Cox's maximum partial likelihood estimator and the corresponding Breslow estimator for the baseline cumulative hazard function are identical to the estimators obtained by maximizing the full likelihood function for the Cox model with respect to the regression coefficients and the baseline hazard simultaneously assuming that the baseline hazard is piecewise constant between the uncensored observations and that all censored observations are censored at the preceding uncensored time.
