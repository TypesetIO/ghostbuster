"Your weird sense of confidence that's spawned from cynicism, your sense of contentment that's present when you're high or somewhere nice, that weird euphoria you get when you absolutely lose your shit at someone's joke or they lose their shit at yours, I'm that weird feeling of warmth that you get with that girl you've got absolutely no shot with, I'm your acceptance that the fact you've got no shot with the coolest person you've ever met and you're totally fine with it because you just like hanging out, I'm the positive side of your shameless hedonism that tells you to go out and alter your brain so that you can explore new faucets of you consciousness, I'm that deeply embedded happiness that comes from your knowledge that you live in a universe with more awesome shit than you can ever imagine."
