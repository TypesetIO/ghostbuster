Most of these OTUs are typical members of activated sludge microbial communities, such as Tetrasphaera (2.9% Ϯ 1.3%) (41) , which is a known phosphate-accumulating microorganism, and Saprospiraceae (6.6% Ϯ 3.5%), filamentous bacteria with a still-unknown role in activated sludge (39) .Saprospiraceae was the highest-abundance OTU, with stable 16S rRNA gene and transcript abundances throughout the year, while our previous study noted it as the second most abundant OTU (3) .
