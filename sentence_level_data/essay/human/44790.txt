Architectured foams that are based on the known mathematical triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) with regular and smooth geometries without discontinuities are being investigated as a novel and attractive alternative owing to their good mechanical performance [26] [27] [28] [29] .TPMS-based foams can be used as lightweight cellular materials in many technological applications such as in acoustic absorption and battery electrodes [30] [31] [32] , as load-bearing materials [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] , or as reinforcement phases [41] [42] [43] [44] in designed interpenetrating phase composite materials.
