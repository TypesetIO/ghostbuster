While this difference in the hemodynamic response to resistance and aerobic BFR exercise is likely driven by a differential degree of motor unit recruitment for the same relative intensity on the spectrum of intensities for each mode of exercise, without any detailed assessment of autonomic function there is no evidence in our data to suggest any differential regulation of the hemodynamic response to aerobic BFR exercise, but perhaps some evidence for BFR resistance exercise.
