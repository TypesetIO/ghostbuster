With the additional OH surf (+1 OH), E a of the RDS (R4) was increased to 1.74 eV for Pd 8 /CeO 2 (111) + V O and was also increased to 1.13 eV for Pd 8 /CDC(100) + V O .Further OH surf addition (+2 OH) resulted in the RDS barriers of 1.66 and 1.29 eV for Pd 8 /CeO 2 (111) + V O and Pd 8 / CDC(100) + V O , respectively.
