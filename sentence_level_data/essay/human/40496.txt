25 Liu and co-workers also developed novel thiol and pH dual-responsive CPMs based on an amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PCL-b-P(OEGMA-co-MAEBA)), which could largely minimize the premature leakage of drug under physiological conditions and exhibit accelerated drug release under mildly acidic pH and/or reductive microenvironment.
