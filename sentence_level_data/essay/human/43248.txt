The combined effect of the Zeeman and hyperfine modulation, described by the black line and dots, shows a field dependence approaching |B â†’ | 4 in the high-field limit (B > 5 T), where t starts to converge to the experimental value (19) .The green curve in Fig. 2 , relative to the single electronic spin contribution, shows that in this regime the leading mechanism is the modulation of the Zeeman energy.
