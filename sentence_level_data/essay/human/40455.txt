Several national campaigns have been set up across Europe, North America, and Australia to alleviate social isolation and loneliness among older people including, the Monalisa initiative in France (https://www.monalisa-asso.fr), the Coalitie Erbij in the Netherlands (https://www.samentegeneenzaamheid.nl), the campaign to end loneliness in the United Kingdom (http://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org.uk), the RISE campaign in Canada (https://rise-cisa.ca),Connect2affect in the United States (https://connect2affect.org) (Valtorta, Moore et al., 2018) , and the Australian coalition to end loneliness (https://www.endloneliness.com.au).One of the motives of these campaigns is the growing body of literature on the association between social isolation and health (Cummings, 2002; Fitzpatrick, Gitelson, Andereck, & Sue Mesbur, 2005; Merz & Huxhold, 2010) .
