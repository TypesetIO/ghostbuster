At the same time, the volume changes discontinuously by -0.044% and the thermal expansion coefficient drops by a factor of three [33, 30] .Ultrasonic microscopy revealed a strong elastic anisotropy in the metallic phase, which disappears almost completely in the insulating state [34] .X-ray diffuse scattering measurements performed just above the metal-insulator transition by Terauchi and Cohen [35] indicated a lattice instability at the tetragonal R-point with a wave vector parallel to Î“-R and a polarization vector parallel to the c axis.
