Plasmonic nanocrystals (NCs) are a versatile class of nanoparticles that are finding application in several fields: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] they have been proposed for example as chemical probes due to the high sensitivity of their optical response to their immediate surrounding environment, 3, 6, 7 as heat mediators in hyperthermia therapy, 4, 8, 9 and as light concentrators in solar cells.
