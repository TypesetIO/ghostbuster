The dreaded sound heard over the hill,
Every footstep a challenge of will,
*But as I drew nearer the sound was, different, *
Not playful as it was when I'd departed,
Nor cheerful, or melodious at all,
Instead the song was full of anguish,
It sounded nothing like what I recalled,
I ran until my heart was bursting,
The sight of my town set me to cursing,
My friends in rags yet still rehearsing,
Spurred on by some devilish call,
Though exhausted the people noticed,
When I ran in through the main gate,
Their eyes looked up, expressions hopeful,
That I would save them from this fate,
For in my absence they had learned,
That not a one occurrence could pass,
Without a jig, or dancing circle,
Without a chorus to sing en masse,
All this they sang beseechingly
"And so it is," They sang to me,
"One such as you could say and be,
Instead of us, then we'd be free"
Hopelessly I watched them wander,
Their choreographed dances and trills,
