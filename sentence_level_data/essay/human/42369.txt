Various modifications had been investigated over the past for the hydrothermal method to achieve the vertical (c-oriented) ZnO NRs and to control the shape, aspect ratio, and density by adjusting the growth parameters like the growth time, temperature [16] , substrate annealing treatment [17] , and the precursor concentration [18] [19] [20] .There have been very few research studies where the seedless growth of ZnO NRs has been explored [21] [22] [23] , so in this report, we have systematically focused on the factors affecting the growth of ZnO NRs in the seedless growth process.
