These reconstructions can be converted into predictive computational models through the application of condition-specific constraints 9 , including (meta-) omics and nutritional data, and linked together to interrogate strain-resolved, personalized microbiome models 10, 11 .Hence, the COBRA approach is well suited for the exploration of metabolic human microbiome cometabolism 12, 13 .To facilitate the genome-scale reconstruction of the thousands of known species inhabiting humans 14 , semiautomated reconstruction tools, such as CarveMe 15 , MetaGEM 16 , MIGRENE 17 and gapseq 18 , have been published.
