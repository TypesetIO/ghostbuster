They appear on application of uniaxial stress or on doping of VO 2 with small amounts of Cr, Fe, Al, or Ga of the order of few percent [20, 31, 2] .The phase diagram of Cr doped VO 2 as given by Pouget and Launois [31] is shown in Fig. 3 .This phase diagram differs slightly from that given by other authors, which fact has been attributed to differences in sample preparation and stoichiometry [20, 64] .Lateron, a similar phase diagram was reported for V 1âˆ’x Al x O 2 by Ghedira et al. [65, 66] .According to Fig. 3 , Cr-doped VO 2 enters, on cooling, the monoclinic M 2 phase in a first order metal-insulator transition [64] .
