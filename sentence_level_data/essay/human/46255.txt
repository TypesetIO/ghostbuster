Indeed, given that the magnitude of the hemodynamic response in LP was typically greater than in TM, the present study lends some support to aerobic BFR exercise being preferential compared with BFR resistance exercise when undertaken chronically to develop muscle size and strength, in particular when the hemodynamic response is a factor for consideration when selecting the mode to be used for exercise training (Loenneke et al. 2012b ).
