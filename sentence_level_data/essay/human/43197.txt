Although gene expression analyses are based on the comparison of the average gene expression in one group (NASH patients, regardless of their differences in histological presentation) relative to that of another group (controls), and therefore reveal those genes that are on average most strongly regulated across all patients, the large number of patients included in metabolomic data sets (n = 535 versus the typical n = 30-40 in gene expression studies) allow identification of subtypes of NASH patients based on their individual metabolomic profile.
