Both are crucial for the inclusion of not yet routinely annotated species-specific pathways (for example, drug metabolism) 9 .To overcome these limitations, we have developed a semiautomated curation pipeline guided by manually assembled comparative genomic analyses and experimental data 19 , which previously enabled the generation of AGORA, a resource of 773 genome-scale reconstructions of human gut microorganism strains, representing 605 species and 14 phyla 20 .
