In the Salmonella model, lack of IL-35 expression by B cells resulted in enhanced Th1 cell responses and an increase in the number of macrophages in the spleen (Shen et al., 2014) .Another independent study has shown that IL-35-stimulated B cells produce IL-35 and are able to inhibit experimental uveitis on adoptive transfer (Wang et al., 2014) .It has also been proposed that Breg cells are critical in maintaining invariant natural killer (iNKT) cell homeostasis in humans (Bosma et al., 2012) .These examples also show the advancement in the understanding of the pleiotropic role of Breg cells in the suppression of immune responses, given that Breg cells have the capacity to target many immune-system cells to exert suppression (Figure 1 ).
