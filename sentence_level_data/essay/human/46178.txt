To circumvent these issues, several groups have used great ape iPS cells to study differences in gene expression in cell types present in early development (Benito-Kwiecinski et al., 2021 ; Field et al., 2019 ; Kanton et al., 2019 ; Pavlovic et al., 2018 ) .While the use of iPS cells addresses many of the confounding factors present in post-mortem comparisons, they also introduce new issues such as interspecies differences in iPS cell differentiation kinetics, efficiency, and maturation.
