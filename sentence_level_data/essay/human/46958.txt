To evaluate the potential impact of DISC1 mutations in regulating proliferation of neural stem cells, we generated forebrain organoids from previously characterized iPSCs derived from a schizophrenia patient with the DISC1 mutation (D3-2) and from an unrelated healthy individual as a control (C1-2) (Chiang et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2014) .To minimize potential accumulated neurodevelopmental deficits caused by the DISC1 mutation, we analyzed forebrain organoids at as early as 20 days when VZ-like structures are already well established (Qian et al., 2016) .We labeled cells in the S phase of cell cycle with EdU followed by analysis 16 hr later.
