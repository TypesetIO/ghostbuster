The incorporation of halogens, such as bromine and chlorine, in polymers has historically been instrumental in enhancing their flame retardancy [10] [11] [12] , thermal stability [13] [14] [15] , and mechanical strength [16] [17] [18] .These properties have rendered halogen-containing polymers indispensable in applications ranging from construction materials to electrical devices [19] [20] [21] .
