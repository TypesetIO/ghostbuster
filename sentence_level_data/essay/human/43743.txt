The successful result of this approach provided a future motivation to implement this type of system for other crops (Kitano et al., 2019) .A robotic manipulator was used to recognize seven vegetables by famous DL feature extraction/detection architectures, but the recognition accuracy should be further increased by proposing some key modifications to the models applied in this research (Zheng et al., 2018) .To recognize Legacy Blueberries plants, a Computer Numerical Control (CNC)-based system was developed and a CNN was proposed to achieve a good performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
