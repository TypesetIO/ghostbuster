In recent years, more and more scientists applied machine learning methods to automatically assign ICD-9 codes such as support vector machine (SVM) [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , Naive Bayes [6] , [7] , k-nearest neighbors [8] , [9] , topic model [10] , [11] , and other techniques based on Natural Language Processing [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] .Perotte et al. [5] proposed novel evaluation metrics, which reflect the distances among gold-standard and predicted codes and their locations in the ICD-9 tree.
