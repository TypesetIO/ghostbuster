Mutant C. elegans strains, lacking the activity of certain desaturases, were used as a model organism in research devoted to the anti-inflammatory effects of PUFAs in reproduction, neurobiological studies, as well as in experiments on the nematode life span and ontogenesis (67) .Importantly, C. elegans does not express such mediators of inflammation as TNF-α and NF-κB, extensively used for evaluating the severity of inflammation in other vertebrate animal models and humans.
