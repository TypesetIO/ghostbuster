Our group and others recently found that Fkbp51 plays a role in synaptic plasticity [5, 58] .Neuronal polarization is a dynamic process including microtubule protein transportation, cross-linking between microtubules and other proteins, as well as the internal traction force in the axon [16, 83, 86, 87] .In Fkbp51 KO neurons, the microtubule dynamic was altered due to the downregulation of microtubule-associated protein and significant upregulation of Parkin, which stabilized the microtubules.
