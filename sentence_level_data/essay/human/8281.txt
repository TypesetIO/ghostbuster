I roll my shoulders back as I see the mop of blond hair walk into the restaurant, I follow the man until he sits down, I sigh and shake my head trying to put all the memories I have with the man out of my mind, sure I grew up with him as my brother since I was 7, but when I was 20 and he was 22 he betrayed me, it doesn't matter that my part- no, my Ex-partner was killed by him.
