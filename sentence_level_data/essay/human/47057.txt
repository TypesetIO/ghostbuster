According to X-ray measurements by Marezio et al., each of the three low-temperature phases shows a particular distortion pattern of the atomic arrangement especially of the characteristic vanadium chains [20] .Whereas in the M 1 phase both the metal-metal pairing and the zigzag-type lateral displacement are observed on each chain, in the M 2 phase only half of the chains dimerize and the zigzag-type deviations are reserved to the other half of the chains.
