In this letter, we have studied interlayer transport by using focused ion beam (FIB) nanofabrication for the precise current path along the c-axis and in the hexagonal plane of micron-size Fe 3 Sn 2 , commonly used in applications [26, 27] .We not only delineate anisotropy of the Hall tensor by directional transport, but we also show for the first time the existence of THE and skyrmion bubbles when the magnetic field is applied in the hexagonal plane for the out-of-plane direction of current.
