The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, and species of the related genus Bombus (bumblebees) have recently been shown to harbour a stably associated gut microbiota consisting of bacterial taxa found neither in solitary bees nor in the environment (Babendreier et al., 2007; Cox-Foster et al., 2007; Koch & Schmid-Hempel, 2011a; Martinson et al., 2011) .As in other animals, these bacteria might possess important symbiotic functions in the gut and, hence, substantially influence the health of their host.
