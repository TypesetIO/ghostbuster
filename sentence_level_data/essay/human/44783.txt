In recent years, cellular materials have gained considerable attention owing to their excellent specific stiffness and strength [1] [2] [3] , as well as their high energy absorption ability [4] [5] [6] [7] and multifunctional characteristics [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .Periodic cellular materials [13] generally consist of materials with two-dimensional lattices, for example in the form of honeycomb or three-dimensional lattice structures such as rhombic dodecahedrons.
