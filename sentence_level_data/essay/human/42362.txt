Among these, ZnO nanostructures (micro/nanorods) are receiving special interest due to its promising piezoelectric properties along the c-axis, wide bandgap of 3.4 eV, large exciton binding energy of 60 meV, high thermal conductivity, strong room-temperature luminescence, showing good transparency in the visible and high infrared spectrum, and high electron mobility which are useful in many applications [7] .ZnO devices can be synthesized by thin films or single crystals with the help of physical and chemical methods and have been tested in electronics, photonics, and optoelectronics devices.
