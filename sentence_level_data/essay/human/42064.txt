Since diatoms have potential enough to grow and divide in Ti-spiked growth medium, high-solubility Ti substrates can thus be used for biomineralization in diatom cells [66] . Basharina et al., 2012 [67] performed a one-stage doping process to integrate Ti into the frustules of Synedra acus in a microincubator where 10 mM sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3 ) and 10 mM titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4 ) were mixed into the growth medium.
