The objectives of this research are to simulate a drone frame to optimize the bottom cover, to study and compare concept shapes of the top cover, arm, leg bracket, and bottom cover of a drone using a trade-off study, and to analyze the force that is generated by the motors in order to determine how much the drone can handle.
