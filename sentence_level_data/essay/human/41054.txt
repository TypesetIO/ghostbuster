For example, a recent review addressed the crop water stress by the machine learning approach (Virnodkar et al., 2020) .A review article summarized the statistical ML algorithms, which have been implemented for various agricultural operations (Rehman et al., 2019) .In (Huang et al., 2010) , soft computing techniques including fuzzy logic, neural network, genetic algorithm, decision tree, and support vector machine (SVM) were presented for the analysis of soil, precision agriculture, and management of crops.
