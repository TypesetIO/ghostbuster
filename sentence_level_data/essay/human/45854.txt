With P2 injection, the trace concentration remains 0 until t¼ 0.31 s for probe A and t¼0.08 s for probe B. With P3 injection, the trace concentration remains 0 until t ¼0.55 s for probe A and t¼0.43 s for probe B. Concentration peaks are related to the time periods that the tracer is present close to the probe either due to injection or because it has been circulated back to the probe (Yeoh et al., 2005) .
