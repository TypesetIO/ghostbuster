As described by Zvielli et al. (2015) , static methods of calculating ABT may account for (a) the notoriously poor reliability of these scores (Schmukle 2005) , (b) replication inconsistencies, (c) small to moderate effects (Bar-Haim et al. 2007) , and (d) limited clarity regarding whether ABT represents faster threat detection or difficulty disengaging from threat stimuli (Weierich et al. 2008) .
