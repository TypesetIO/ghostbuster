The beneficial effect of vacuum enhancement was further demonstrated for multi-envelope modules at pilot scale [35] .A preliminary evaluation of the impact of mild vacuum in the performance of commercial AGMD modules was carried out in nominal conditions of hot inlet temperature (80 • C), feed flow rate (1100 l h − 1 ), and cold inlet temperature ( 25 • C ).
