It is interesting to note that ndel1 and nde1 show different expression pattern during the mouse neocortical development (Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas, http://developingmouse.brain-map.org).While Nde1 mRNA is more highly detected in the region with high proliferation, such as the VZ, ndel1 is more strongly expressed in the cortical plate, where neurons are localized as a result of neuronal migration at E13.5.
