This method confirmed that biosilica is an effective reducing agent due to the presence of Si-OH groups and capable in synthesis of crystalline Ag-SiO 2 nanohybrid after exposure to 9 mM of silver nitrate solution for 72 h without involving any hazardous chemical [60] .Synthesized dendritic nanostructures showed fluorescent property.
