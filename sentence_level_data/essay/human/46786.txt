Although culturing of some of these bacteria has been reported (Engel & Moran, 2013; Engel et al., 2012; Killer et al., 2009 Killer et al., , 2011;; Koch & Schmid-Hempel, 2011b; Olofsson & Va Â´squez, 2008) , their characterization is based mainly on 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing (Engel et al., 2012) .Recently, the betaproteobacterium and one of the two gammaproteobacteria were assigned to two novel genera and species with the names Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola, respectively (Kwong & Moran, 2013) .
