Recently, we assessed the predictive value of a number of miRNAs for the diagnosis of T2D incidence in the CORonary Diet Intervention with Olive oil and cardiovascular PREVention (CORDIOPREV) study (ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT00924937) and demonstrated that when combined with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a group of nine miRNAs (miR-9, miR-28-3p, miR-29a, miR-30a-5p, miR-103, miR-126, miR-150, miR-223-3p, and miR-375) provided a higher predictive value in the T2D diagnosis than clinical parameters (fasting glucose, 2h glucose of oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT], and HbA1c).
