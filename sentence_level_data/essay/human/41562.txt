The Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT, first described and used by Benton & Van Allen, 1968 ; see Benton, Sivan, Hamsher, Varney, & Spreen, 1983 , for the official reference of the test) is one of the oldest tests measuring human face processing ability, and probably still the most widely used in clinical neuropsychological evaluations.
