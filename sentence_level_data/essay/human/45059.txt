Examples for the latter can be found in some SMOS and SMAP products, which use modelled temperature estimates from ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) and NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5), respectively, as input to the soil moisture retrieval algorithm (Kerr et al., 2012; O'Neill et al., 2018) .Research is needed to quantify the degree to which that affects inter-comparisons between the satellite soil moisture retrievals and soil moisture estimates from models that rely on the same temperature input (such as MERRA2, ERA-Interim/Land, or others; e.g. Chen et al., 2018) .
