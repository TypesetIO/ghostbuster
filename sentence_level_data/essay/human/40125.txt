Excess NADH causes the inhibition of mitochondrial beta-oxidation and accumulation of intracellular lipids [34] .Furthermore, ROS generated by CYP2E1 can peroxidize the mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes that are involved in beta-oxidation (e.g., acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1).
