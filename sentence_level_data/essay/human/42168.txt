RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) are essential enzymes for all viruses with RNA genomes ( Černý et al., 2014) .Unlike other polymerases, the RdRp have high mutation rates (in the order of 10 −4 ), which is crucial to generate the variability of RNA viruses, being important to their evolutionary strategy (Vignuzzi et al., 2006) .
