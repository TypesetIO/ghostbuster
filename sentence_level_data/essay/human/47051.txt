This outcome can be attributed to the gradient structure inherent in the latter sample, represented in Fig. 12a , analogous to the observations made by Onal et al. [201] , wherein certain regions are marked by diminutive struts and heightened porosity, consequently rendering the structure more susceptible to structural vulnerability.
