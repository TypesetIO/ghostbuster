Thl mediator, IFN-y, have multiple antitumor effects: unmasking the immunogenicity of cancer cells by up-regulating surface MHC class I, as illustrated for 005 GSCs (Fig. L4 ); inducing Thl differentiation; stimulating proliferation of NK, NKT, and T cells with induction of cytotoxic effectors; and antiangiogenesis (14) .IFN-y stimulates the production of angiostatic chemokines, such as MIG and IP-10, which have direct and CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)3-independent effects on endothelial cells, in addition to their inflammatory effects on lymphocytes (32, 33) .Systemic administration of IL-12, however, has been associated with serious toxicity as well as marginal clinical responses in most patients.
