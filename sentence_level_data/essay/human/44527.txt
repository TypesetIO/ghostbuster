Consistent with the IHC labeling results, western blotting revealed Parkin protein is significantly elevated in the Fkbp51 KO hippocampus (p < 0.001) compared to WT hippocampus (Fig. 5C ), although the lack of a difference in mRNA expression (Fig. 5D ) suggested that Parkin could be post-translationally regulated by FKBP51.A Image acquisition and data processing.
