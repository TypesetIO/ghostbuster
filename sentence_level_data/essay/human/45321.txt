Storsteen and Rumpca (2000) evaluated the performance of two types of geosynthetics in strip applications (Linq Tac-711N and Strata Grid-200) to retard reflection cracking in asphalt overlay constructed on top of an existing concrete pavement [30] .Twelve test sections (each sections consisting of 10 joints in the passing and driving lanes) were constructed and monitored for a period of three years.
