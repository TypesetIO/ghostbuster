Cinnamaldehyde and MCD are tentatively thought to act by inhibiting ATPases, cell wall biosynthesis and by changing membrane structure and integrity [24, 1, 3] .It has been previously demonstrated that the length of hydrocarbon chain outside the ring and lipophilicity, considerably affect antifungal properties of cinnamaldehyde [25, 26] .
