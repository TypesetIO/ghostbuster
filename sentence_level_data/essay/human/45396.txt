They can occur, for example, if the actual measurement footprint of a satellite extends beyond the grid cell boundaries associated with the chosen, unknown "truth", if an inadequate soil parameterization in a radiative transfer model causes the soil moisture retrievals to represent deeper soil layers than the chosen, unknown "truth", or if point-scale ground measurements are used as a reference for grid cell-scale soil moisture dynamics.
