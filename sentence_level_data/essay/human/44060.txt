Another study of biochar production from palm oil empty fruit bunches showed that the energy balance of the process was positive, and the energy output/input ratio was 2.75 (Harsono et al., 2013) . Abrego et al. (2018) reported that the energy balance was reasonably good (105%) for biochar production from cashew nutshells.
