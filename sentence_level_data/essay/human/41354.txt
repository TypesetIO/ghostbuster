Of course, this became most obvious from the fact that crystals could even break at the transition [28, 2] .Furthermore, X-ray measurements revealed large thermal displacements in the rutile phase of both stoichiometric and Cr-doped VO 2 , which exceed the values measured in the respective low-temperature phases as well as in the neighbouring rutile compounds TiO 2 and CrO 2 considerably [20, 27] .Rao et al. observed a large anisotropy of the thermal expansion in the rutile phase (α ≈ 5 − 6 × α ⊥ ) [29, 30] , which causes a strong temperature dependence of the electric field gradient at the vanadium site [31] .
