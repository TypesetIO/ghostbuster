Later studies have shown that mice harboring a B-cell-specific deletion of IL-10 also display a Treg cell deficiency, which is associated with an outgrowth of pro-inflammatory T cells after the induction of autoimmunity (Carter et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2011) .Directly, cognate interactions between Breg cells and T cells are thought to control Treg cell induction, given that B cells deficient in major histocompatibility complex class II (Yoshizaki et al., 2012) and B7 (Mann et al., 2007) do not exhibit regulatory function (Rosser et al., 2014a) .
