Calibration can be accomplished manually or using autocalibration tools in SWAT [21] or SWAT-CUP [22] .A good example based on the calibration process involves the streamflow process in which the water balance is contained in the terrestrial phase of hydrology, including evapotranspiration, lateral flow, surface runoff, return flow, tile flow (if present), channel transmission losses, and deep aquifer recharge.
