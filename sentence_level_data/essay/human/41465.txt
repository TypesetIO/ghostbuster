For example, they can be very light but also very strong, providing insights for designing attractive synthetic structures with excellent mechanical properties [19] [20] [21] .Wang et al. [22] conducted numerical analysis on the crashworthiness of 12 types of hexagonal prism biomimetic structural tubes using finite element method, and their results showed that the energy absorption capacity and deformation mode of the biomimetic hexagonal prism tube were superior to the original tube.
