According to the United Nations (UN), 6. 5 billion people will live in cities by 2050, and more than 60% of the world's population will be concentrated in cities (Schuurman and Baccarne 2012) .On the global scale, International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that the steady increase in smart cities' expenses will rise to $ 158 billion by 2022 (Twice as much as $ 80 billion in 2018) (Visan and Ciurea 2020) .Rapid population growth, besides putting considerable pressure on current cities, will pose serious threats to the future, leading to increased demand for services, housing facilities beyond the capacity of cities, as well as irreparable damage to the environment.
