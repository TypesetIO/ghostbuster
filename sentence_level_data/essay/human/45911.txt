Heritage tourism is a growing area of research in the tourism field (Weaver, 2011) .While several studies examine the motivation (e.g., López-Guzmán et al., 2019; Medina-Viruel et al., 2019; Poria et al., 2004; Poria et al., 2006a) , on-site experiences (e.g., Kempiak et al., 2017; Poria et al., 2003) , and post-consumption behaviours (Chen and Chen, 2010; Su and Hsu, 2013) of heritage tourists, limited attention has been devoted to how motives of visitation influence emotional aspects of heritage consumption.
