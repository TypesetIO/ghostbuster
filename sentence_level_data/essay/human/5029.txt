it's amazing how you can connect to the internet of the future in the past just by bringing something from the future into the past, it's a strange occurrence called "temporal information bridging" and is based on the idea that the universe is composed of information, so bringing something from one point in time doesn't necessarily disconnect it from that point in time, in other words because there's an internet signal in this specific location at some point in the future, bringing a laptop connected to that specific internet connection at that point in time into the past doesn't terminate the connection.
