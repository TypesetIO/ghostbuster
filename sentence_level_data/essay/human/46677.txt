The porosity introduced to meet the stiffness requirement has an additional positive effect in terms of bone in-growth; the bone tissue precursors (osteoblasts and cell fluids) are able to permeate the voids and to create new bone structures inside the porous parts, thus leading to a better stabilization of the implant component and a reliable long-term fix [7] .
