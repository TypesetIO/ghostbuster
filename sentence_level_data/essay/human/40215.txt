4, 5 These features, especially the low melt elasticity, limit their processability in cast film extrusion, foaming, blown-film manufacture, thermoforming, and fiber spinning etc. 1, 4 Long chain branching (LCB) and polymer chain entanglement in PHB and PLAs can improve their processability. 6 ] [11] [12] [13]
