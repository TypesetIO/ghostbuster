CARs feature a molecular design combining an ectodomain comprising an antigen-binding module, typically a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody, and a T cell signaling module (CD3Î¶: CD3 zeta-chain) connected to single/multiple intracellular signaling domain(s) of a costimulatory molecule such as CD28, 4-1BB, or OX40 [1, 2] .Each of these elements has a distinctive function, which can be optimized by variations of these domains.
