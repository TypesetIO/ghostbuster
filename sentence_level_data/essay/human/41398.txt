We rated all cross-sectional studies of associations with long-term PM exposure that used measured or modeled PM values from a period prior to (and not overlapping with) outcome assessment as fair to reflect the relative strength of these studies compared with typical cross-sectional studies with simultaneous exposure and outcome assessment; we rated those using an exposure period overlapping with or after outcome assessment as poor for study quality.
