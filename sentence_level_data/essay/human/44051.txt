Taking into account the impact of this sector in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions (7.8% in 2014 (Morlet et al., 2017) ), the solution of using natural refrigerants has raised significantly focus on solving the main issues historically related to those: flammability for hydrocarbons, toxicity for ammonia and low performance for CO 2 at warm environmental temperatures (Lorentzen, 1995) .For CO 2 , the low performance is related to its low critical temperature (~31 â€¢ C), which forces the refrigeration cycle to work in transcritical conditions during the heat rejection process.
