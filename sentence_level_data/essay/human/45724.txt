In contrast, CarveMe by design removes all flux inconsistent reactions from a metabolic reconstruction 15 .Compared with the KBase draft reconstructions, AGORA2 had a significantly higher percentage of flux consistent reactions despite being larger in metabolic content, as well as a significantly higher flux consistency than gapseq and MAGMA (Fig. 3a,c ; P < 1 × 10 −30 , Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
