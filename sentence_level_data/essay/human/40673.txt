Such a conjecture is consistent with the results of previous studies, which show that having subjects earn money in another task prior to making decisions produced more self-serving behavior both in the lab (for example, Bosman, Sutter, and van Winden, 2005; Cherry, Frykblom, and Shogren, 2002) and in the field (Clingingsmith, 2013) .
