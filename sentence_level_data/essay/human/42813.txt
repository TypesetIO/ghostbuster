In some cases, the biochar maintains the morphology of its feedstock; for example, the morphology of wood-derived biochar is similar to that of raw wood, i.e., fibrous ridged surface with vertically aligned micro-channels (Dong et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2015) .Similarly, lignin imparts the natural macrostructure of initial biomass to the final hydrochar, as lignin is slightly affected by HTC (Cheng and Li, 2018) .
