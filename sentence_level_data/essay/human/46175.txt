In the past few million years, humans have evolved a multitude of unique phenotypes (Shave et al., 2019 ; Vanderhaeghen & Polleux, 2023 ) .For example, our cardiovascular system has evolved to enable extended periods of physical exertion and the unique aspects of our nervous system enable human language and toolmaking (Shave et al., 2019 ; Vanderhaeghen & Polleux, 2023 ) .Previous research suggests that much of human adaptation may be caused by changes in gene expression (Fraser, 2013 ; King & Wilson, 1975 ; Reilly & Noonan, 2016 ; Romero et al., 2012 ) .To catalog these changes, studies have compared gene expression in post-mortem tissues of humans and our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Blake et al., 2020 ; Kelley & Gilad, 2020 ; Ma et al., 2022 ) .
