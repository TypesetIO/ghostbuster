Based on the S language collectively designed by Rick Becker, John Chambers, Doug Dunn, Jean McRae, and Judy Schilling in the 1970s, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman developed the R programming language in 1991 (Femi & Samuel, 2022; Hackenberger, 2020; Vidoni, 2021b) .R is applied in linear regression, statistical inference, processing and computation (e.g., machine and deep learning to parallel computing, Bayesian statistics, big data processing, data visualization, and meta-analysis), bioinformatics, machine learning algorithms, elaboration of analysis (e.g., correlation, clustering and data reduction), time series, data manipulation (e.g., data analysis, calculation, and management), and graphical display (Hackenberger, 2020; Pfeiffer & Pia, 2013; Pothigai & Sundararajan, 2021) .
