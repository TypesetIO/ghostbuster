When (Nielsen et al., 2015) applied the levamisoleresinate to small baits for foxes, the normal levamisole actually appeared more effective than the resinate, likely because the foxes were able to detect the relatively high proportion of levamisole-resinate (Nielsen et al., 2015) .Levamisole-resinate might thus only be effective when it is applied to food items which allow for a low proportion of levamisole-resinate relative to food content, masking the increased volume.
