"For the last time, I don't know what number you're thinking of"
"Come on" said the prison guard
"This has to be some sort of hate crime" said the prisoner to himself then to the guard "Also for the last time, a medium talks to ghosts, they don't know what you're thinking"
"Wait really?"
"Yes"
"How was I supposed to know that"
"Because I kept telling you"
"So how do you make someone a medium"
"Wait you thought getting me to guess the number you're thinking of would make me a medium"
"Does it not?"
"Again it would be psychic and no"
"So what makes a medium?"
