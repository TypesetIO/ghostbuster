There are various chemical and physical-based approaches for the synthesis of one-dimensional c-oriented ZnO nanorods such as the physical vapor deposition method [11] , sputter deposition method [12] , galvanic-based cell [13] , hydrothermal method [14] , and so on, but among these methods, the simple hydrothermal approach has advantages of low-temperature growth (< 100 Â°C) and low-cost technique.
