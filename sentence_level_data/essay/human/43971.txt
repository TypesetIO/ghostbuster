As already pointed out by Goodenough, the exact position and width of the d bands is subject not only to the p-d hybridization but also strongly influenced by direct metal-metal interactions [3, 6] .In particular, in the rutile structure such interactions involve the d x 2 âˆ’y 2 orbitals, which experience strong overlap parallel to the rutile c axis.
