The success of establishing cellular communications at THz depends on the development of high-power solid-state transmitter sources, low-losses connectors, and the most critical component in the evolution of high-directivity antennas to compensate for path-loss of humid atmospheres that can exceed over 100 dB/km and to allow signal propagation for at least 100 m away, to maintain a short-range line-of-sight (LoS) communication system at this frequency regime.
