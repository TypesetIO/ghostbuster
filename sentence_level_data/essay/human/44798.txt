Most studies on the relation between economic inequality and exclusion with political attitudes remain limited to studying the effects of income inequality (e.g. Anderson and Singer 2008; Kumlin 2011; Solt 2008 Solt , 2010 Solt , 2015;; Zmerli and Castillo 2015) .Income inequality is a relative measure (the spread of income of all individuals is compared).
