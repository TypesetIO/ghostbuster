Although the proposed CNN architecture achieved good accuracy, there is still room to improve the performance further by the implementation of various available well-known CNN models, the advanced training techniques like transfer learning/finetuning techniques could be utilized and some other crops should also be considered in the future (Fan et al., 2018) .A research addressed the problem that occurs due to the critical distribution of heads of sorghum by a CNN model named RetinaNet on the UAV images; the system can achieve better performance by including diversity in the dataset (Ghosal et al., 2019) .A hybrid approach consisting of SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) and Hue properties was combined with a CNN model for the detection of flowers in a Soybean field and a single axis robot was used for this purpose, and the authors also provided a future direction-that seed pod counting should also be considered (Yahata et al., 2017) .A research utilized the UAV for the detection, classification, counting of trees, and evaluation of varieties of citrus by the implementation of a famous DL detection model named YOLO-v3 (Ampatzidis & Partel, 2019) .
