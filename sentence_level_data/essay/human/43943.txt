Several experimental studies on electroporation (using ultra-high-voltage and ultra-short-duration pulses) have shown a greater electric field and temperature distribution when the electrodes are positioned parallel to the muscle fiber orientation (longitudinally), compared with perpendicular to the muscle fiber. 20, 21 This suggests that RF lesions may extend greater longitudinal to muscle fiber orientation compared with perpendicular, especially with very high power-very short RF applications (ie, 90 W/4 s).
