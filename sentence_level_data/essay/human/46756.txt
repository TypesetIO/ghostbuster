Moreover, aerodynamic characteristics analysis for different airfoils have also been conducted at different corners of the world like Mahmud [7] analyzed the effectiveness of an airfoil with bi-camber surface, Kandwal et al. [8] studied the fluid flow and aerodynamic forces on an airfoil, Robert [9] studied the variation of pressure distribution over an airfoil with Reynold's Number, Sharma [10] analyzed the flow behavior around an airfoil body, etc.
