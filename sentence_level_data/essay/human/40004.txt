It is noteworthy that in the 32-year history of intergovernmental climate policy, none of the attempts by any government or any international agreement has had such a drastic mitigation impact on air pollution (Lenzen et al., 2020) .Data collected on the level of concentration of aerosol optical depth (AOD) by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) satellites indicated a massive reduction by 50% of AOD in the India region's air quality.
