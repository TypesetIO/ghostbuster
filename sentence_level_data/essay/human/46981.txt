We compare the proposed HRL with a greedy revision algorithm, which firstly decides to revise the whole profile E u if log P (y = 1|E u , c i ) < µ 1 , and further removes a e u t ∈ E u if its cosine similarity with c i is less than µ 2 .In Figure 4 (b), we tune µ 1 from -2.5 to 0 with interval 0.5, and tune µ 2 from -0.1 to 0.1 with interval 0.04, and obtain the best HR@10 as 77.44% when µ 1 =-1 and µ 2 =0.1, which is 2.27% less than HRL+NAIS.
