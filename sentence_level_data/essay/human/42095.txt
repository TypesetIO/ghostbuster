Other inflammatory cytokines that are known to be critical for Th17 cell differentiation, such as IL-21 (Yoshizaki et al., 2012) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, in combination with IL-15) (Rafei et al., 2009) , have also been shown to be important in Breg cell differentiation.
