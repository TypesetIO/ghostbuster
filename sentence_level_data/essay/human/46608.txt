Similarly, poorer perceived social support at baseline was a significant predictor of poorer recovery one year later (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.35) [52] , and of longer time-to-remission in a study of initially depressed elderly individuals (Hazard Ratio = 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) [53] .However, none of the seven studies had high quality scores (****), with five receiving medium (***), and two low scores (**).
