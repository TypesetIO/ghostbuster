However, several studies suggest that mutual error correlations may exist between commonly used data set combinations (Yilmaz and Crow, 2014; Pan et al., 2015) , resulting from representativeness errors (e.g., if a land surface model used within TCA models a deeper layer than the sensing depth of two satellite data sets that are used in the triplet) or from unrecognized common data.
