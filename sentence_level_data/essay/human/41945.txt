First, decisions are made by holistic evaluation of potential courses of action (Lipshitz, Klein, Orasanu, & Salas, 2001) .Second, decisions are recognition based in that the decision maker relies on recognition of the situation and pattern matching courses of action rather than comparing alternatives (Klein & Calderwood, 1991) .Third, decision makers adopt a satisfying criterion rather than search for an optimal solution (Klein & Calderwood, 1991) , searching for a workable rather than optimal solution.
