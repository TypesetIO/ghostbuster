The 1983 Panel Report on "United States -Imports of Certain Automotive Spring Assemblies" examined claims by Canada regarding an exclusion order issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, including arguments that "The exception under Article XX(d) did not justify trade restrictive measures taken pursuant to Section 337 on two grounds: (1) differential treatment of foreign products involving a separate adjudicating process was not 'necessary' to secure compliance with United States patent laws, and (2) the law with which compliance was sought (Section 337) was 'inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement', i.e.Article III of the GATT".
