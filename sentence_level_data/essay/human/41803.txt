H 2 -TPR, XPS, time-resolved CO oxidation, in situ XRD, and DFT calculations indicate that the reducibility was increased because the two methods lowered E vf .XPS and ToF-SIMS with the DFT calculations of E Cu,seg further revealed that the two support-tuning strategies can yield activity increase larger than just the sum of the two effects because increased ease of Cu segregation in the cube reinforces the effect of Cu doping; thus, simultaneous application of facet control and doping was clearly verified to synergistically increase the efficiency of supported metal catalysts for reactions involving redox process.
