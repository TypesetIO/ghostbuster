Some stingless bees also use resin and cerumen pieces to barricade the nest entrance at night, or when disturbed (e.g., Meliplebeia tanganyilcae medionigra (Cockerell) and Plebeiella lendliana (Fries) [10, 66] .Some species (e.g., Melipona panamica, Melipona flavolineata, and other Melipona species) even keep a designated resin ball on hand for this purpose [12] .
