Although both studies used the same BFR cuffs, this difference in hemodynamic stress may be a result of slight differences in the method for applying an individualized restriction pressure being 80% resting sBP (mean AE SD; 123 AE 8 mmHg) in the present study versus 60% of limb occlusion pressure (LOP) (126 AE 16) in the prior study.
