It is therefore recommended to verify orthogonality and zero error correlation assumptions by using -where available -multiple data set triplets and checking for consistency between different TCA implementations (Dorigo et al., 2010; Draper et al., 2013) , or by using the recently proposed TCA extension that utilizes four or more data sets to diagnose the existence, and estimate the magnitude of error correlations (Gruber et al., 2016b; Pierdicca et al., 2017) .
