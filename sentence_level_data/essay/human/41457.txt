These findings are in line with earlier findings arguing that the mathematical ideas leading up to the discovery of new knowledge are gradually formulated and justified as stages progress (Brousseau, Brousseau & Warfield, 2001 , 2013; Brousseau & Gibel, 2005) .Moreover, classroom discourse and social interaction also encourage the recognition of connections between ideas and the reorganization of knowledge (Lampert, 1986) and can have a powerful influence on academic motivation and achievement (Light & Littleton, 1999; Wentzel, 1999) .Therefore, it is thought that the interaction amongst the learners in the classroom, which is quite common in a-didactical learning situations, plays an effective role in students' discovery of the mathematical knowledge at stake.
