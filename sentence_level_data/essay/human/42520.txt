Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), one of the most frequently used microarray technologies in clinical laboratories, detects chromosomal losses and gains throughout the genome by comparing the hybridization intensities between a patient's DNA and a normal control's DNA.FISH analysis, chromosome analysis, or molecular techniques are usually performed after CMA to confirm the results and identify translocations or insertions associated with the copy n umber changes.
