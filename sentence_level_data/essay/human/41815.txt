Further mappings by ITC analyses revealed that a short, predicted coiled-coil region of Nde1 (aa 239-286, termed ''Nde1 CT-CC'') is both necessary and sufficient for DISC1 binding (Figures 1C, 1D3, and S1C3) .The DISC1 C-terminal helical region is predicted to contain a separate coiled-coil region (residue 765-835) that is connected to the upstream helical region with a flexible and variable linker (Figure 1A ).
