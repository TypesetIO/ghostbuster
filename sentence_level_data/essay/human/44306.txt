Other studies confirming the positive relationship between ERM implementation and firm performance are: results of the empirical analysis show that ERM implementation has a significant Indonesian State-Owned Enterprises positive impact on firm's performance (Shad &Woon-Lai, 2015) ; the study provides strong evidence of a positive relationship between Enterprise Risk Management implementation and performance in the Nigerian banking sector (Soliman & Adam, 2017) ; the results show that firms with advanced levels of ERM implementation present higher performance, both as financial performance and market evaluation (Florio & Leoni, 2016) ; and the basic argument presented in this paper is that the relation between ERM and firm performance is contingent upon the appropriate match between ERM and the following five factors affecting a firm: environmental uncertainty, industry competition, firm size, firm complexity, and board of directors' monitoring (Gordon et al., 2009) .
