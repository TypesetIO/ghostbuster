This trend is similar to the relationship observed between the experimental calorimetric parameters and a H0 in Fig. 6 .Extrapolation of the data shown in Figure 10(c ) indicates that G out should reach near-zero (10 Ã€4 ) values when a H0 % 0.70, confirming the critical initial (or achieved) water activity needed for C 3 S hydration to proceed.
