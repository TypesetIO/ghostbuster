Chemical stabilisation by cement or lime is a proven technique for improving the performance of soil (Basha et al., 2005; Ismail et al., 2002; Kolias et al., 2005) . Hamidi and Hooresfand (2013) indicated that the addition of polypropylene fibres to cemented soil increases the peak and residual shear strength and the principal stress ratio at failure by increasing the fibre content.
