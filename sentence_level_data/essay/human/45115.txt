In fact, it has been demonstrated that high-intensity RT produces greater muscle activation as compared to low-intensity BFRT (Kubo et al. 2006; Manini and Clark 2009) .However, these findings are not consensual, as others have found otherwise (Suga et al. 2012; Takarada et al. 2000) ; importantly, significant differences between RT protocols can be identified between these studies, which could explain the dissonant results.
