The similar hemodynamic responses between LI and LI+BFR are in contrast to previous reports that observed increased blood pressures with aerobic BFR exercise to levels greater than an equal-intensity control exercise bout, combined with a greater HR and reduced SV while maintaining _ Q (Renzi et al. 2010; Staunton et al. 2015; Sugawara et al. 2015; Ozaki et al. 2010) .Typically, such different responses to BFR exercise between studies may be attributed to factors associated with the application of BFR such as cuff width and cuff pressure (Loenneke et al. 2012a) , and the exercise type (Staunton et al. 2015) , combined with individual factors such as limb circumference (Loenneke et al. 2012a) .
