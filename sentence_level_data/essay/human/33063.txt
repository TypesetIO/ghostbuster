As a result, the PCIOT question can be constructed as such:
  * P = elderly patients within the risk of developing a hospital-acquired pressure injury
  * I = minimization of shear and friction
  * C = usage of pressure redistribution
  * O = reducing the rates of HAPI development
  * T = a year
  * PICOT Question:
