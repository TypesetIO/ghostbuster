The wind load for the various shape of tall buildings has been popularly investigated in numerous experimental and numerical wind engineering studies (Li et al. 2018 , Mukherjee and Bairagi 2018 , Xu et al. 2017 , Kumar and Dalui 2017 , Kar and Dalui 2016 , Bhattacharya et al. 2014 , Tamura et al. 2013 , Tanaka et al. 2013 , Ming and Yong 2011) .Wind loads on tall buildings can be reduced by using two approaches; one is the use of the "Aerodynamic Mitigation" technique, and the second is the use of the "Aerodynamic shape optimization" technique (Mooneghi and Kargarmoakhar 2016) .
