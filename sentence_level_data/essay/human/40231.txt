18 The generally accepted process of peroxide induced cross-linking of polymers follows three key steps: (i) the primary radical formation from the thermal decomposition of peroxide, (ii) H abstraction from polymer backbone by free radicals of peroxide generated in step (i), and (iii) the bimolecular radical recombination of polymer radicals from step (ii) to generate C-C cross-links (Scheme 1). 9 Whereas, there is limited information on the chemical position(s) associated with crosslinked molecular chains to form a gel network structure.
