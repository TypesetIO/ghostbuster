Primarily, Breg cells function by skewing T cell differentiation in favor of a regulatory phenotype in both mice (Carter et al., 2011) and humans (Flores-Borja et al., 2013) .The importance of B cells in the maintenance of the regulatory T (Treg) cell compartment can be derived from early studies showing that Treg cells are reduced in B-cell-deficient mMT mice (Sun et al., 2008; Tadmor et al., 2011) .
