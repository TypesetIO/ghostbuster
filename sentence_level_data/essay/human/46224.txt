The photocatalyst provided surface adsorption sites for pollutants and O3, and the adsorbed O3 promoted the formation of free O • , which then reacted with H2O to form • OH.O2 and O3 reacted with e − ; h + reacted directly with pollutants or with H2O or OH − to generate • OH; and O • , • O3 − , and • O2 − , which were generated in the plasma ozone oxidation medium, were eventually converted to • OH.
