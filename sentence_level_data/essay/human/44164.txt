Previously reported to kill tumor cells by immune-mediated mechanisms, such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC, as well as by programmed cell death via cross linking of the antibody on the cell surface, it is now known that daratumumab also induces immunomodulatory effects via several different pathways that contribute to killing of CD38 + immune cells that modulate T cell activity, namely MDSC, TReg, and BReg.
