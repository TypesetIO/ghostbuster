The features of Palmyra palm tree-derived hard carbon (namely, the presence of heteroatomic N/O surface groups, mesoporous structure, and extended graphitic interlayer distance [0.39 nm]) resulted in a reversible capacity of 214 mAh/g at 0.02C and 97% cycle retention after 100 cycles, although the high capacity in the low-voltage plateau region indicated that the nanopores were filled with stoichiometric sodium during Na + storage [145] .
