Future studies should aim to explore the interplay between cooling rates, molecular structure, and thermal transitions in greater detail, possibly employing advanced techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms at work.
